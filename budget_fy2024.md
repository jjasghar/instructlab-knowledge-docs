## THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT

## To The Congress of The UniTed sTaTes:

When I took office 2 years ago, COVID-19 was raging and our economy was reeling.  Millions of workers had lost their jobs, hundreds of thousands of businesses closed, supply chains were snarled, and schools were still shuttered.  Families across the Nation were feeling real pain. But today, 230 million Americans have been vaccinated.  We have created a record 12 million jobs, and unemployment is at a more than 50-year low, with near-record lows for Black and Latino workers and women.  Wages are rising, inflation is slowing, manufacturing is booming, and our economy is growing.  More Americans have health insurance than ever before, and a record 10 million Americans have applied to start a small business-each application an act of hope.  Our economic plan for the Nation is working, and American families are starting to have a little more breathing room.

I ran for President to rebuild our economy from the bottom up and middle out, not from the top down-because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do well.  We all do well.  For too long, though, the backbone of America, the middle class, has been hollowed out.  Too many American jobs were shipped overseas.  Unions were weakened.  Once-thriving cities and towns have become shadows of what they were.  My economic vision is about investing in those places and people who have been forgotten.  That is what we have done in these historic past 2 years.

Together, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act are among the most significant public investments in our Nation's history, expected to draw more than $3.5 trillion in public and private funding for infrastructure and industries of the future-including clean energy.  It is simple:  you cannot be the number one economy in the world unless you have the best infrastructure in the world.  So we are finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, railways, ports, airports, water systems, and more to keep our people safe, our goods moving, and our economy growing.  We have already announced over 20,000 projects and awards, creating tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs while requiring that all construction materials are made in America.  Americans everywhere can take pride in seeing shovels in the ground for that work.

Meanwhile, the CHIPS and Science Act is making sure America once again leads the world in developing and manufacturing the semiconductors that power everything from cellphones to cars.  The United States invented those chips, and it is time that we make them at home again so  our  economy  never  again  relies  on  chips  manufactured  abroad.    Private  companies  have already  pledged  $300  billion  in  new  investments  in American  manufacturing,  many  thanks to this law, and they are breaking ground on facilities that will employ tens of thousands of Americans with good jobs and breathe new life into communities across the United States.

At the same time, we are taking on powerful special interests to cut costs for working families-for example, lowering healthcare and prescription drug costs by extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and capping insulin prices and out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare. The Inflation Reduction Act also gives Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices, lowering prices for Americans and saving taxpayers billions of dollars a year.  It makes the world's most

significant investment in fighting the existential threat of climate change-lowering families' utility bills, building cleaner and more resilient water systems, investing in rural communities, and leading the world to a clean energy economy.

Throughout, we have delivered on our commitment to fiscal responsibility, cutting the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion in the first 2 years of my Administration-the largest reduction in American history.  I have signed into law additional deficit reduction by finally making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share, including with a new 15 percent minimum tax on billion-dollar corporations, many of which had been paying zero in taxes.  We have also stood firm in our commitment to not raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year.

Now, it is time to finish the job, building on the ambitious progress we have made with new investments in America's future.  My 2024 Budget is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America in a fiscally responsible way that leaves no one behind.  The Budget continues lowering costs for families-with new measures to expand health coverage, cap prescription drug costs, invest in quality child care, build affordable housing, reduce home energy bills, make college more affordable, and more.  This Budget protects and strengthens Social Security and Medicare-lifelines that tens of millions of seniors have paid into their whole lives with every paycheck so they can retire with dignity.  It rejects any cuts to these programs, extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust  Fund  by  at  least  25  years,  and  invests  in  service  delivery  so  that  seniors  and  people with disabilities can access the benefits they have earned.  This Budget also keeps growing our economy by investing in the foundation of its strength:  the American people.  That means helping families by providing paid family and medical leave and restoring the full Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty in half in 2021 to the lowest level in history.  It means expanding small business loans; standing up for workers and their fundamental right to organize; investing in science and innovation; expanding access to preschool; and improving pathways to community college, career-connected high schools, and other high-quality job training.  It also means working hard to make our communities safer, expanding access to mental healthcare, ending cancer as we know it, and much more.

In addition, this Budget cements our commitment to confronting global challenges and keeping America safe.  It outlines crucial investments to out-compete China globally and to continue support for Ukraine in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.  It also continues our work to restore America's global leadership-reviving key alliances and partnerships, strengthening our military, fostering democracy and human rights, protecting global health, honoring our veterans, fixing our immigration system at home, and advancing cybersecurity through implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy I just signed.

Importantly, my Budget does all of this while lowering deficits by nearly $3 trillion over the next decade.  We more than fully pay for these investments in our future by asking the wealthy and big corporations to pay their fair share.  We propose a billionaire minimum tax, requiring the wealthiest Americans to pay at least 25 percent on all of their income, including appreciated assets-because no billionaire should ever pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.  This Budget also proposes quadrupling the tax on corporate stock buybacks, so companies invest more in production to improve quality and lower prices, and less in buybacks that only benefit shareholders and CeOs.  This Budget closes tax loopholes for the wealthy and cracks down on tax cheats, and it once again ensures that no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in new taxes, period.

Today, our Nation is at an inflection point that will determine our future for decades to come. But  because  of  the  investments  that  we  have  made,  the  United  States  of  America  is  better

positioned to lead than any Nation on earth.  The Budget reflects our values as a Nation-a Nation of good people, growing in a new age of possibilities, and standing as a beacon to the world.  Together, let us put those values into practice and prove that democracy delivers as we keep building a stronger, fairer economy that leaves no one behind.

JOSePH R. BIDeN JR.

The WhiTe hoUse, March 2023

## DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

When the President took office, America faced acute and historic challenges: a once-in-a-century  pandemic;  an  economy  gripped  by  the  most severe downturn since the Great Depression; a worsening climate crisis; and a legacy of racial injustice. From the first days of his Administration,

the President moved swiftly to tackle these challenges, deliver results for the American people, and  ensure  the  Nation  emerged  stronger  than ever. Two years later, while significant challenges remain, America has made historic progress under the President's leadership.

## GROWING THE ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND MIDDLE OUT

In  January  2021,  the  President  inherited  a pandemic that was raging and an economy that was reeling. Roughly one percent of Americans were  fully  vaccinated,  less  than  half  of  the Nation's schools were open for in-person instruction, and the virus had dramatically upended the lives  of  Americans  all  across  the  Nation.  More than 10 million Americans were unable to find work  and  the  unemployment  rate  stood  at  6.3 percent. Millions of women were forced to drop out of the labor force. Hundreds of thousands of small  businesses  had  shuttered. The American economy was facing one of its darkest moments in a generation.

In the face of these crises, the President immediately took action to rescue the economy. Within months of taking office, he signed into law the American  Rescue  Plan  Act  of  2021  (American Rescue Plan), which helped change the course of the pandemic and jumpstart a historic recovery. The American  Rescue  Plan  funded  an  unprecedented  vaccination  campaign  that  has  helped fully  vaccinate  nearly  230  million  Americans against COVID-19, re-opened schools for in-person learning, helped 200,000 child care providers keep their doors open, helped cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021, provided emergency rental  assistance  payments  to  households  that

may have otherwise faced eviction, and delivered critical relief to American families.

even as the President  took  urgent  action  to bring the economy back from the pandemic and jumpstart a recovery, he also began implementing his strategy to rebuild the U.S. economy from the  bottom  up  and  middle  out-not  from  the top down. Over the course of just two years, the President  amassed  a  series  of  historic  legislative accomplishments and took executive actions that  are  laying  the  foundation  for  steady  and stable  growth  over  the  long  term-rebuilding America's  infrastructure  and  building  a  clean energy economy, fueling a manufacturing boom that is bringing record investment and jobs back to  the  United  States,  supporting  workers  and small  businesses,  promoting  fair  competition, and  lowering  costs  for  families  on  everything from prescription drugs to healthcare to energy bills.

Just over two years after the President took office, it is clear that his economic strategy is working. Since January 2021, the economy has added more than 12 million jobs-more jobs created in just two years than any president has ever created  in  an  entire  four-year  term. The  job  market has recovered all of the jobs that were lost

during the pandemic-and faster than in the past three  recoveries.  The  unemployment  rate  has fallen from 6.3 percent to 3.4 percent-the lowest level in 54 years. Hispanic and African American unemployment rates are near record lows. As of January  2023,  women's  unemployment,  which was more severely impacted by the onset of the pandemic, is at its lowest level in 70 years. More Americans  are  working  than  at  any  point  in American  history.  2021  and  2022  were  the  two best years for small business creation on record. Companies have invested more than $300 billion in American manufacturing since the President took office. The President's actions to lower prescription drug costs and make the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share will reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decade.

To  close  tax  loopholes  that  allow  some  of the  most  profitable  corporations  in  the  United States to avoid paying Federal income taxes, the President signed into law a 15-percent minimum tax on the profits that large corporations-those with over $1 billion in profits-report to shareholders. He signed into law a surcharge on corporate  stock  buybacks,  which  encourages  businesses to invest in their growth and productivity as opposed to paying out corporate executive profits  or  funneling tax-preferred profits to wealthy shareholders.  The  President  signed  legislation into  law  that  will  crack  down  on  wealthy  tax cheats-without increasing audit rates for families or small businesses making under $400,000 per year.

## Providing Families More Breathing Room and Economic Security

As  the  economy  continues  to  transition  from a  historically  strong  recovery  to  stable,  steady growth, the President has remained laser-focused on his top economic priority: taking action to lower costs for working families and give the American people  more  breathing  room.  While  more  work remains-and  the  Nation  could  see  setbacks along  the  way-there  are  clear  signs  that  the President's economic strategy is working: annual

inflation has fallen over the past six months, even as the labor market remains strong and real wages are rising.

The strength of America's jobs recovery, along with  the  Administration's  policies  designed  to help  workers  and  families,  have  left  families more  economically  secure  than  before  the  pandemic. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, households are now less likely to be delinquent on their credit card bills and mortgages, and more likely to  have  health  insurance. A  record-setting  16.3 million  people  signed  up  for  Patient  Protection and  Affordable  Care  Act  (Affordable  Care  Act) coverage  this  year,  and  the  national  uninsured rate  hit  an  all-time  low  last  year.  Families  are facing fewer evictions and foreclosures than they were before the pandemic, and bankruptcy rates are lower as well. This economic security is giving  families  peace  of  mind  and  breathing  room that they did not have before the pandemic. Child poverty also fell to a historic low in 2021, and the President has taken action to lift nearly one million children out of poverty by modernizing nutrition benefits.

Last summer, the President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (Public Law 117-169), historic legislation to lower costs for families, build a clean energy economy and combat the climate crisis, reduce the deficit, and finally ask the largest corporations to begin to pay their fair shareall while ensuring that no one making less than $400,000 per year would pay a penny more in taxes. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs by capping out of pocket expenses for seniors at $2,000 per year and finally letting Medicare  negotiate  prices.  It  lowers  healthcare costs by ensuring millions of Americans continue to  save  hundreds  per  year  on  health  insurance premiums.  Consumers  in  these  plans  saved  an average  of  $800  on  their  premiums  in  2021  as part of the American Rescue Plan. It lowers energy costs by putting America on track to meet the President's climate goals, which will save families an average of $500 per year on their energy costs.

At  the  beginning  of  this  year,  key  provisions of  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  took  effect  that

are  already  delivering  results  for  the American people.  As  of  January  2023,  insulin  is  capped at  $35  for  a  monthly  prescription,  more  recommended  vaccines-including  shingles  and  tetanus-are free for Americans on Medicare Part D, and  pharmaceutical  companies  have  to  write  a check to Medicare if they raise drug prices faster than inflation. When working- and middle-class Americans buy an electric vehicle or make their homes more efficient, they can now get a tax credit-putting  money  back  in  their  pockets  while helping accelerate a clean energy transition that leaves no one behind.

At  the  same  time,  the  Administration  has worked to unsnarl pandemic-driven supply chain bottlenecks  that  contributed  to  higher  prices, helping further ease inflationary pressures. Within  months  of  taking  office,  the  President signed  two  landmark  executive  Orders  directing agencies to fortify the Nation's critical supply chains. The President also launched a first-ever Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force, designed to pivot, adapt, and surge support to immediate and evolving supply chain challenges. Together, these actions have made an impact. Despite dire warnings  of  a  looming  supply  chain  meltdown ahead  of  the  holidays  in  2021,  holiday  season delivery  times  were  below  pre-pandemic  levels and more than 97 percent of packages were delivered on time or with minimal delays. Progress strengthening America's supply chains continued in  2022. The  average  cost  of  shipping  an  ocean container is trending down, congestion at major ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach has eased, and  more  than  90  percent  of  goods  at  grocery stores and drug stores are in stock and available on shelves-in line with pre-pandemic averages.

The President has also taken bold action to help address high gas prices resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last year, the President authorized the historic release of 180 million barrels  from  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve,  and he  rallied  international  partners  to  release  an unprecedented  amount  of  oil  to  stabilize  global markets. Today, gas prices in the United States have fallen sharply from their summer peak in

2022, even as the economy and job growth have remained strong.

## Promoting Competition and Entrepreneurship

The President's economic plan is also focused on promoting fair competition across the American economy to help ensure small businesses and entrepreneurs have an opportunity to thrive. As the President has said, 'capitalism without competition isn't capitalism. It's exploitation.'

In  July  2021,  the  President  signed  a  historic  executive  Order  creating  a  White  House Competition Council and directing Federal agencies  to  take  action  to  spur  greater  competition across industries. Since then, agencies have made significant progress implementing the executive Order-taking more than 90 actions across major sectors of the economy. Already, those actions have  helped  level  the  playing  field  for  small businesses  and  unlocked  real  savings  for  the American people.

The Administration's actions to crack down on unfair  hidden  junk  fees  are  producing  results. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has targeted overdraft and bounced check fees, surprise overdraft fees, and surprise depositor feesefforts that have already driven changes at 15 of the largest 20 banks and that are expected to reduce fees by more than $1 billion annually. The Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a rule  to  require  airlines  and  online  booking  services to show the full price of a plane ticket up front. DOT also published a dashboard of airline policies when flights are delayed or cancelled due to issues under the airlines' control, leading nine airlines to change policies to guarantee coverage of  hotels  and  10  airlines  to  guarantee  coverage of meals, none of which were guaranteed before. The  Federal  Communications  Commission  released new rules that will go into effect next year to require broadband providers to use 'nutrition labels'-similar to those used for food productsto convey key information to consumers about internet service options in an accessible format.

At the same time, the President has taken action  to  help  lower  the  average  cost  of  hearing aids by as much as $3,000 per pair by allowing Americans  to  purchase  hearing  aids  over-thecounter-producing  savings  for  the  nearly  30 million Americans with hearing loss. The Federal Trade Commission released a proposed rule to ban non-compete clauses, which stifles wage growth for  American  workers  by  making  it  more  difficult for workers to leave for higher-paying jobs. In December 2022, the President signed into law the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, which updated merger filing fees for the first time in more than 20 years, raising them on the larger mergers that contribute to consolidation and reduce competition while lowering fees on smaller acquisitions.  To  help  lower  shipping  costs,  the President also worked with the Congress to pass the  Ocean  Shipping  Reform Act  of  2022,  which will cut costs for shippers, and in turn American families, and ensure fairer treatment for exports sent by American farmers and ranchers.

## Powering a Manufacturing Boom across America

A  core  part  of  the  President's  economic  plan is  an  industrial  strategy  to  revitalize America's manufacturing  base,  strengthen  supply  chains, and position U.S. workers and businesses to lead in global competition-and that strategy is paying  off.  Since  January  2021,  the  economy  has added  more  than  800,000  manufacturing  jobs, the  most  jobs  added  over  a  two-year  period  in over 35 years. Manufacturing as a share of Gross Domestic Product has returned to pre-pandemic levels-a  faster  recovery  than  any  other  business  cycle  since  1953. The  President's  plan  has catalyzed private investment that will grow the economy, ensure that those benefits are broadly shared  in  communities  across  the  Nation,  and

bring good-paying manufacturing jobs back from overseas.

In August 2022, the President signed into law the  CHIPS  and  Science  Act  (Public  Law  117167)-historic bipartisan legislation that is helping  power  America's  manufacturing  boom  and bringing  supply  chains-and  jobs-back  to  the United  States.  The  law  serves  as  a  down  payment on the future of discovery that will create good-paying  manufacturing  jobs,  support  local economies  and  communities,  connect  regional industries  with  high-tech  research  and  development,  and  bolster  U.S.  competitiveness  globally. The CHIPS and Science Act, along with the Inflation  Reduction Act, have sent clear signals to the private sector about the demand for clean energy  and  innovative  technologies.  In  just  the two  years  since  the  President  took  office,  the Administration's actions have spurred more than $700  billion  in  private  investment  in  manufacturing, utilities, and energy from more than 200 companies in all 50 States.

The President has also delivered on his commitment to make the promise of Buy American real.  In  his  first  week  in  office,  he  issued  an executive Order that created the first-ever Made  in  America  Office  within  the  Office  of Management and Budget, strengthened and centralized the waiver review process, and directed the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council to  close  loopholes  in  Buy American  regulations. Since then, the FAR Council published the most significant  updates  to  the  Buy American Act in nearly 70 years to ensure taxpayer dollars create good-paying jobs here at home, strengthen critical supply chains, and position U.S. businesses to compete in strategic industries. These new rules already raised the domestic content threshold to qualify  as  Made  in America  from  55  percent  to 60 percent-part of a phased increase up to 75 percent by 2029.

## DELIVERING PROGRESS ACROSS AMERICA

As the President's economic plan continues to produce results, the Administration has also delivered historic progress that is helping build a better  America-rebuilding  the  Nation's  crumbling  infrastructure,  leading  the  world  in  tackling  the  climate  crisis,  delivering  for  veterans, making America's communities safer, promoting women's health, and advancing equity across the U.S. economy and Nation.

## Rebuilding America's Infrastructure

For decades, members  of both parties in Washington  have  talked  about  the  urgency  of rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructurewithout ever delivering. But in the fall of 2021, after  working  across  the  aisle  to  forge  consensus  and  compromise,  the  President  signed  into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law)-a  once-in-ageneration investment in the Nation's infrastructure and competitiveness that is ushering in an infrastructure decade.

In the  year-and-a-half  since  the  President signed  the  Bipartisan  Infrastructure  Law,  the Administration has been hard at work delivering on  the  law's  promise:  rebuilding  roads,  bridges, ports, and airports; upgrading public transit and rail systems; replacing lead pipes to provide clean water; cleaning up pollution to protect the health of  Americans;  providing  affordable,  high-speed internet  to  every  family  in  America;  delivering cheaper and cleaner energy; and creating goodpaying jobs.

To  date,  the  Administration  has  announced nearly $200 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure  Law  and  more  than  20,000  specific  projects,  reaching  over  4,500  communities across  all  50  States,  the  District  of  Columbia, and the Territories. That funding has allowed the Administration to: launch 3,700 bridge repair and replacement projects across the Nation; begin repair of over 69,000 miles of roadway; award funds for  more  than  3,000  new  clean  transit  school buses; increase  enrollment  in  the  Affordable

Connectivity  program  that  helps  ensure  households  can  afford  the  high  speed  internet  they need  for  work,  school,  healthcare,  and  more  to over  16  million  households;  and  approve  State plans for water funding, electric vehicle charging networks, and high-speed internet deployment.

earlier  this  year,  the  President  announced awards  for  regionally  or  nationally-significant projects,  including  over  $2  billion  to  upgrade some  of  the  Nation's  most  economically  significant bridges and over $1.2 billion in Mega grants. These  infrastructure investments will create good-paying jobs-including union jobs and jobs that do not require a four-year college degree. The projects will grow the economy, strengthen supply  chains,  improve  mobility  for  residents,  and make America's transportation systems safer for all users.

To  ensure  projects  are  delivered  on  time,  on task, and on budget, the Administration released The Biden-Harris Permitting Action Plan to Rebuild America's  Infrastructure,  Accelerate  the Clean Energy Transition, Revitalize Communities, and Create Jobs to strengthen Federal permitting and environmental reviews, as well as The BidenHarris Action Plan for Accelerating Infrastructure with  more  than  20  commitments  from  Federal agencies pledging to speed progress. The Administration also launched the Infrastructure Talent  Pipeline  Challenge,  with  more  than  350 commitments from companies, colleges, and nonprofits to invest in workforce development.

## Leading the World to Tackle the Climate Crisis

In the two years since taking office, the President's leadership to tackle the climate crisis has boosted U.S. manufacturing and deployment of cost-cutting clean energy technologies, put the Nation on a durable path aligned with limiting warming  to  1.5  °C,  galvanized  global  action  by partners and the private sector, and advanced environmental justice.

On  the  first  day  of  his  Administration,  the President rejoined the Paris Agreementstrengthening  international  partnerships  that are  key  to  addressing  the  climate  crisis  on  the global stage. The President set an ambitious domestic goal to reduce greenhouse gas pollution 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 and has rallied countries around the world to make their own bold contributions. At the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the President announced that America would lead the way as the first Nation to require major Federal contractors to  publicly  disclose  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions and climate-related financial risks and set science-based emissions reduction targets.

In  signing  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  last year,  the  President  secured  the  largest  investment to advance energy security and combat climate change in American history. The Inflation Reduction Act makes direct investments in innovation and deployment of cost-saving clean energy technologies while lowering costs for American families who  electrify their homes,  purchase electric vehicles, and install rooftop solar. As climate disasters continue to threaten communities across the Nation, the law also includes critical investments  in  climate  resilience. The  Inflation Reduction  Act  will  spur  unprecedented  actions to ensure that these transformative investments create good-paying and union American jobs and benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities-including  through  a  new  $3  billion  grant program for community-based organizations that work to address local pollution concerns.

At  the  same  time,  the  Administration  has launched numerous initiatives to accelerate America's clean energy future and conserve America's  ecosystems.  To  jumpstart  an  electric transportation  future  that  is  Made  in America, the President brought together automakers and autoworkers  around  an  ambitious  goal  that  50 percent of vehicles sold by 2030 will be electric. The Administration has announced new climatesmart agriculture and forestry initiatives, protections for cherished landscapes and habitats, and the America the Beautiful Initiative to conserve

30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. To ensure no one is left out of the benefits of the clean energy  economy,  the  President  established  the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plan Communities and economic Revitalization to  direct  Federal  technical  assistance  and  resources  toward  investments  in  the  places  that kept America's lights on for generations.

environmental justice is embedded in all the work  the  Administration  is  doing  to  tackle  the climate  crisis.  The  President's  Justice40  initiative ensures that 40 percent of the benefits from Federal  investments  in  climate  and  clean  energy  are  delivered  to  disadvantaged  communities. The Administration launched a Climate and economic Justice Screening Tool to help agencies better identify communities that can benefit from the Justice40 Initiative.

## Honoring America's Commitment to the Nation's Veterans

One of the Nation's most sacred obligations is to care for America's veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. The President delivered on this  commitment by signing the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), the most significant bill in American history to  address  veterans'  exposure  to  burn  pits  and other toxic substances. Under the law, more than five million veterans will be eligible for services, including  expanded  access  to  healthcare  and disability  compensation benefits. The PACT Act also expands access to benefits and services for veterans' families, caregivers, and survivors, and strengthens the President's Cancer Moonshot initiative, making progress toward addressing rare cancers that make up approximately 25 percent of all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cancer diagnoses.

The Administration is also taking key steps to address veteran suicide. In July 2022, VA transitioned the Veterans Crisis Line to the new 988 Suicide  and  Crisis  Lifeline's  national  network, making it easier for veterans in crisis to connect

to more than 500 suicide prevention coordinators and ensuring follow-up services.

Recognizing  the  diversity  of  America's  veterans, the Administration is also taking action to advance equity across veterans' services. In the last  year, VA  committed  to  improving  maternal health and expanded access to specialized cancer screenings and reproductive healthcare. In addition to ending the ban on transgender service, the Administration is committed to providing gender affirming care to the Nation's veterans-and last year,  the  VA  announced  that  it  was  extending survivor benefits to certain survivors of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex veterans.

## Making America's Communities Safer

From day one,  the  President  has  taken  decisive and historic action to make America's communities safer. Last year, the President brought Members of Congress from both parties together to secure the Bipartisan Safer Communities Actthe first significant piece of legislation to address the  epidemic  of  gun  violence  in America's  communities in three decades. This historic legislation expands background checks and funds crisis intervention,  including  red-flag  laws,  and  helps keep guns out of the hands of people, including convicted  dating  partners,  who  are  a  danger  to themselves  and  others.  The  Act  makes  historic investments in violence prevention and reduction programs, addresses the youth mental crisis by expanding  community  violence  prevention  programs,  and  expands  trauma-informed  services to mitigate the impact of violence. It also builds on the Administration's efforts to crack down on ghost guns, rogue dealers, and gun trafficking.

The  President  has  also  been  clear  about  the Administration's  commitment  to  investing  in safe,  effective,  and  accountable  community  policing and crime prevention. In December 2022, the President signed the bipartisan funding bill that  increased  funding  for  the  Department  of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Solutions Office  by  more  than  $150  million  and  included

$50 million for the Agency's Community Violence Intervention programs. In addition to these critical  investments, the President issued a historic executive  Order  last  year  to  advance  effective accountable policing and reform America's criminal  justice  system.  The  Administration  is  also strategically deploying historic funding to reduce gun  crime.  The  Administration  made  certain American Rescue Plan funding-$350 billion in State and local funding, and $122 billion in K-12 funding-available  as  unprecedented  resources for States and cities to invest in hiring officers for accountable community policing, as well as crime prevention and intervention.

## Promoting Women's Healthcare and Defending Reproductive Rights

In  June  2022,  the  Supreme  Court  issued  the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated  a  woman's  constitutional  right  to choose,  taking  away  a  right  from  the American people that had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years. In the wake of this ruling, the President has been clear that the only way to secure a woman's right to choose is for the Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe . In addition, the  President  has  defended  reproductive  rights and protected access to safe and legal abortionincluding  signing  two  executive  Orders  and  a Presidential  Memorandum  to  safeguard  access to medication abortion and contraception, ensure patients  receive  emergency  medical  care  and healthcare free from discrimination, protect patients' and doctors' privacy, and support patients traveling out of State for medical care.

Thanks  to  the  Affordable  Care  Act  and  the Administration's  work  to  protect  and  expand it, more  Americans  have  healthcare  coverage than at  any  other  time  in  history-and  women can no longer be charged more for health insurance simply because they are women. Last year, the Administration approved requests from more  than  half  of  the  States  and  the  District of Columbia  to  extend  postpartum  Medicaid

coverage to 12 months. In June 2022, the President and Vice President released the Administration's Blueprint  for  Addressing  the  Maternal  Health Crisis, a whole-of-Government approach for combatting maternal mortality and morbidity and reducing persistent disparities.

## Advancing Equity

On his first day in office, the President signed a sweeping executive Order directing the entire Federal  Government  to  advance  an  ambitious equity and racial justice agenda-not as a oneyear project, but as part of a sustained commitment  to  make  the  promise  of  America  real  for every American. Since then, the Administration has made significant progress advancing equity across the Federal Government, including by releasing a second executive Order that strengthens its ability to create opportunities for communities and populations that have been historically underserved, and continues to build an America in  which all  can  participate,  prosper,  and  reach their full potential.

The President also hosted the first White House Conference  on  Hunger,  Nutrition,  and  Health in  over  50  years  and  released the Biden-Harris Administration  National  Strategy  on  Hunger, Nutrition, and  Health ( National  Strategy  on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health ) to end hunger and reduce  diet-related  chronic  diseases,  which  disproportionately  impact  historically  underserved communities, by 2030. The National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition,  and  Health provides  a  roadmap  of  actions  Federal  agencies  will  take  and makes a call to action to all sectors of society to collectively achieve the President's goals.

The Administration  has  also  announced  new steps to advance economic justice. These include taking  action  to  eliminate  administrative  barriers  that  disproportionately  impact  workers  of color,  delivering equitable infrastructure investments  through  the  Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law,  advancing  environmental  justice  through the Justice40 Initiative, and making historic investments  in  tribal  communities.  The

Administration has also made progress delivering on the President's goal of increasing the share of awards  to  small  disadvantaged  businesses (SDBs)  from  roughly  10  percent  to  15  percent by 2025. In 2021, the Administration awarded a record level of contracting dollars to SDBs, and based on initial data, 2022 is expected to exceed that record.

The  Administration  has  deployed  record  investments to tribal nations and Native communities,  including  through  the  American  Rescue Plan,  the  largest  direct  Federal  investment  in Indian  Country  in  history,  and  the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest single investment in  infrastructure  for  Indian  Country  ever.  The Administration has taken additional steps to: improve and standardize tribal consultation; expand protections for tribal victims under the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022; develop new public safety and justice strategies for  Native  communities,  including  to  address the epidemic of missing or murdered Indigenous people; and secure-for the first time in historyadvance  appropriations  for  the  Indian  Health Service, which would ensure a more predictable funding  stream  and  improve  health  outcomes across Indian Country.

In April 2022, the President launched the Rural Partners Network (RPN), which is now supporting  37  rural  communities  across  10  States  and Puerto  Rico.  RPN  is  an  all-of-Government  program that partners with rural and tribal people to  access  resources  and  funding  to  create  local jobs, build infrastructure, and support long-term economic stability on their own terms. Through RPN, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is hiring new full-time Federal staff who are from the region to work hand in hand with RPN community  leaders. There  are  20  Federal  agencies, including  regional  commissions,  contributing  to RPN to ensure selected rural communities have access to the full breadth of resources across the Federal Government.

The President has also signed historic bipartisan  legislation  to  ensure  women  and  Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex

Americans are treated equitably under the law. Last  year,  the  President  signed  the  Respect  for Marriage Act  to  ensure  that  every  Americanno  matter  their  race,  gender,  or  sexual  orientation-can marry the person they love without the threat of government interference. The bipartisan funding  bill  the  President  signed  in  December 2022  included  the  Pregnant  Workers  Fairness Act-which  provides  long-overdue  protections for  pregnant  workers-as  well  as  $700  million for the Violence Against Women Act, the highest funding level in history for the landmark law the President first authored and championed in 1994 and reauthorized in March 2022.

## Making Progress to End Cancer as We Know It

One  year  ago,  the  President  and  First  Lady reignited the Cancer Moonshot, setting an ambitious,  achievable  goal:  to  reduce  the  death  rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25  years,  and  improve  the  experience  of  people and families living with and surviving cancer, ultimately ending cancer as we know it today.

The Cancer Moonshot has spurred tremendous action across the Federal Government and from the public and private sectors, building a strong foundation  for  the  work  ahead.  The  President stood up the first-ever Cancer Cabinet to mobilize the Federal Government, and called on individuals, healthcare providers, and leaders across sectors to step up and take action in five key priority areas: 1) close the screening gap; 2) understand and  address  environmental  and  toxic  exposure; 3)  decrease  the  impact  of  preventable  cancers; 4) bring cutting-edge research through the pipeline to patients and communities; and 5) support patients and caregivers.

To date, the Cancer Moonshot has announced over  25  new  programs,  policies,  and  resources to  address  these  five  priority  areas.  More  than 60 private companies, non-profits, academic

institutions, and patient groups have also stepped up with new actions and collaborations.

Notably, this includes at least one major advancement in each of these priority areas. To improve cancer screening, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued grants as part of an  ongoing  five-year  total  investment  greater than  $1  billion  to  advance  cancer  prevention and control reaching every State, Territory, and tribal  organizations  and  the  National  Cancer Institute  launched  a  large  national  trial  that could  identify  effective  blood  tests  for  the  detection  of  one  or  more  cancers.  Due  to  the President's  leadership  in  delivering  bipartisan  legislation,  the  environmental  Protection Agency, through Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, is cleaning up toxic sites and replacing lead  pipes  and  service  lines  as  part  of  efforts to address environmental and toxic exposures. In addition, VA is implementing the President's bipartisan PACT Act, which includes cancer as a priority category for veterans' benefits claims, helping these veterans gain more timely access to  healthcare  and  other  financial  benefits.  In cancer  prevention,  USDA  announced  its  new Agricultural  Science  Center  of  excellence  for Nutrition  and  Diet  for  Better  Health  to  accelerate  research  on  diet-related  chronic  diseases,  including  cancer  as  part  of  the  Cancer Moonshot  and National  Strategy  on  Hunger, Nutrition, and Health . To drive innovation, the President  launched  the  Advanced  Research Projects  Agency  for  Health,  a  new  agency  to deliver new ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other diseases, appointed its firstever  Director,  and  secured  $2.5  billion  in  initial  investment,  including  $1.5  billion  in  the bipartisan  funding  bill  the  President  signed in December 2022. In addition, to support patients,  tens  of  thousands  of  cancer  patients could see their prescription drug costs go down by  thousands  annually  because  the  President signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 per year for Medicare beneficiaries.

## KEEPING AMERICA SAFE AND RESTORING AMERICA'S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP

As the President delivers results for the American people at home, he has also taken action to restore American leadership on the world stage-leading  with  America's  values,  working in  lockstep  with  America's  allies  and  partners, investing in the Nation's military edge, and addressing the most significant challenges and opportunities before us. In the early years of what will be a decisive decade, America is better positioned than any Nation on earth to win the competition for the 21 st Century.

Under the President's  leadership,  the  United States has rallied the world to support the people of  Ukraine,  deepened  America's  alliances  with europe,  and  strengthened  the  North  Atlantic Treaty Organization, including through congressional support for the accession of two new states, Sweden and Finland. America has provided tens of billions of dollars in direct military and budgetary support to make sure the Ukrainian government can defend its  sovereignty  and  territorial integrity and to protect and provide basic services to the Ukrainian people, including healthcare, education, and emergency personnel. As Russia's invasion  continues  to  displace  Ukrainians,  the United States has welcomed more than 275,000 Ukrainians seeking refuge since March 2022.

In the Indo-Pacific, the President has taken action  to  deepen America's security and economic partnerships to shape the rules of the road and strengthen  America's  edge  in  the  competition with China-including hosting the first-ever U.S.Pacific  Islands  Summit  at  the White  House. At the 2022 G20 Summit in Indonesia, the President demonstrated the Administration's commitment to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment,  which  catalyzes  public  and  private finance to advance climate and energy security, global health security, digital connectivity, gender equity and equality,  and  transportation  infrastructure across the world-all while creating opportunities for American businesses. The President has fostered democracy and shared prosperity in the Western Hemisphere through the Americas Partnership  for  economic  Prosperity,  a  historic new  agreement  to  drive  Western  Hemisphere

economic  recovery  and  growth  and  deliver  for working  people.  The  President  also  hosted  the U.S.-Africa Leaders' Summit, underscoring America's commitment to expanding and deepening America's partnership with African countries, institutions, and people, including supporting the African  Union  to  join  the  G20  as  a  permanent member.

Working with allies and partners, the President has moved swiftly to confront a broad range of pressing global challenges. From his first days in office, the President has led with a bold agenda to address the climate crisis and increase energy security at home and around the world. Through the President's  Emergency  Plan  for  Adaptation and  Resilience  (PREPARE) , the  United  States is helping vulnerable nations build resilience to the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. The Administration  is  also  embedding  the  costs  of climate change into the investment strategies of U.S. development finance institutions and working with America's partners to do the same.

At the President's direction, the United States is  also  taking  action  to  advance  global  public health. To protect the Nation and the world, the President  committed  to  directly  supporting  at least  50  countries,  by  2025,  to  strengthen  and achieve regional, national, and local capacity in five critical areas to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.

Since day one of the Administration, the President  has  called  for  a  new  mechanism  to catalyze  global  progress  to  prevent,  detect,  and respond to infectious disease threats, and together with the G20 and other partners, the United States helped launch and support a historic new Pandemic  Fund  at  the  World  Bank.  This  fund is  working  at  the  national,  regional,  and  global levels to support pandemic prevention, preparedness,  and  response  while  strengthening  local health systems.

In the face of growing threats to women's human  rights  and  opportunity  around  the  world, the Administration continues to advance gender

equity  and  equality  at  home  and  abroad.  The Administration  has  worked  to  prevent  and  respond to gender-based violence, including where rape  is  used  as  a  weapon  of  war.  In  addition, the  Administration  has  supported  the  full  and equal  participation  of  women  and  girls  in  the economy by addressing barriers to participation, which will improve economic security for women and families and promote economic growth and development.

As America leads with diplomacy, a principled and adaptive U.S. military underpins America's global leadership. In line with the 2022 National Defense  Strategy , the  Department  of  Defense (DOD) is advancing American priorities through integrated deterrence, working seamlessly across  all  instruments  of  national  power  and America's global network of allies and partners,

and  buttressed  by  the  strongest  fighting  force the world has ever known. The United States has made disciplined investments to design, develop, and  manage  a  combat-credible  force  that  can deter  Chinese  and  Russian  military  aggression against vital U.S. national interests, and, if necessary, prevail in conflict if deterrence fails. These investments  include  modernizing America's  nuclear  deterrent,  building  resilience  in  the  cyber and space domains, and investing in new applications of artificial intelligence, quantum science, and  biotechnology  with  the  potential  to  revolutionize  how  U.S.  forces  operate. America  is  acting urgently to build enduring advantages across the defense ecosystem-not just within DOD, but also  across  the  defense  industrial  base  and  the array of private sector and academic enterprises that create and sharpen the Joint Force's technological edge.

## GROWING THE ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND MIDDLE OUT

Under the President's leadership-and thanks to the resilience of the American  peoplethe  United  States  has  not  only  met  historic challenges  at  home  and  abroad,  but  is  poised to  emerge  stronger,  more  resilient,  and  more prosperous for decades to come.

The President's economic strategy is producing results-with record-breaking job creation, strong economic growth, major investments in infrastructure, a resurgence  of  American manufacturing, and historic legislative accomplishments that are laying the foundation for  long-term  economic  prosperity.    America  is leading  the  world  in:    building  a  clean  energy economy  and  combatting  the  climate  crisis; turning a generational challenge into an opportunity  to  create  jobs  and  strengthen  U.S. energy  security;  leading  the  industries  of  the future;  and  advancing  environmental  justice. The United States has made smart investments in  America's  communities  and  people  that  are creating more opportunities and advancing equity, security, and dignity.  The President has restored America's  standing  and  leadership  on the world stage-rallying allies and partners to address  some  of  the  most  pressing  challenges around the globe.

The President's Budget details a fiscally and economically  responsible  blueprint  to  build  on this  record  of  progress,  deliver  on  the  agenda he  laid  out  in  his  State  of  the  Union  Address, and finish the job:  continuing to lower costs for families; protecting and strengthening Medicare and Social Security; growing the economy from the  bottom  up  and  middle  out  by  investing  in America and its people; and reducing the deficit

by  asking  the  wealthy  and  big  corporations  to pay their fair share.

Building  on  the  historic  Inflation  Reduction Act  and  other  key  administrative  actions,  the Budget  includes  a  package  of  proposals  that would give the American people more breathing room  and  lower  costs-including for health insurance,  prescription  drugs,  child  care  and preschool, higher education, and housing. The  Budget  honors  the  President's  ironclad commitment  to  protecting  and  strengthening Medicare and Social Security-rejecting any cuts to these programs, proposing reforms that would extend  the  solvency  of  the  Medicare  Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund by at least 25 years, and  investing  in  service  delivery  to  speed  up claims processing and ensure Americans receive the Social Security benefits they have earned.

The Budget proposes smart, targeted investments  to  grow  the  economy  from  the bottom  up  and  middle  out  by  investing  in America and its people.  The Budget invests in the foundations of America's economic strengthfrom manufacturing and infrastructure, to education and job training.  The Budget expands access  to  high  quality  healthcare,  addresses long-standing public health challenges, and helps spur the next generation of medical breakthroughs  that  improve  health  outcomes in diseases such as cancer.  The Budget makes historic  investments  to:    combat  the  climate crisis; advance environmental justice; and ensure  the  clean  energy  future  is  invented, built,  and  made  in  America.    The  Budget  also advances  equity,  dignity,  and  security  across America's  communities  and  economy-making

communities  safer  and  expanding  the  reach  of America's promise.

The Budget also reflects the Administration's commitment to achieving a better future of a free, open, secure and prosperous world, as laid out in the President's 2022 National Security Strategy . As America faces challenges from authoritarian powers  with  revisionist  aims,  a  global  climate crisis, and international economic pressures, it is clear that the need for a strong and purposeful American role in the world has never been greater. The Budget supports American leadership by investing in America's inherent national strengths:  the ingenuity, creativity, resilience, and determination of the American people; America's values,  diversity, and  democratic  institutions; America's technological leadership and economic  dynamism;  and  America's  diplomatic corps, development professionals, intelligence community, and military servicemembers, all of

whom remain unparalleled.  By investing in the underlying sources and tools of American power and  influence,  the  Budget  would  help  America build the strongest possible international coalition  with  the  power  to  shape  the  global strategic  environment  and  solve  shared  global challenges.

In keeping with the President's commitment to fiscal responsibility, the Budget more than fully pays  for  all  of  its  investments,  strengthens  the Nation's  long-term  fiscal  health,  and  keeps  the economic  burden  of  debt  low.    The  President's Budget  reduces  deficits  by  nearly  $3  trillion over  the  next  decade  by  asking  the  wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair  share-while  ensuring  that  no  one  making less than $400,000 pays a penny in new taxes and cutting taxes for families with children and lowincome workers.

## LOWERING COSTS AND GIVING FAMILIES MORE BREATHING ROOM

The President's top economic priority is lowering  costs  for  working  families  and  giving them  more  breathing  room.    While  more  work remains-and  while  America  could  see  more setbacks  along  the  way-there  are  clear  signs that the President's strategy is working.  Annual inflation has fallen for seven consecutive months. Gas  prices  are  down  roughly  $1.60  per  gallon since  their  peak  last  summer.    Real  wages  are up  over  the  last seven  months  for  working Americans.    Thanks  to  the  Inflation  Reduction Act, the  United  States  is  lowering  costs  for prescription  drugs,  healthcare,  and  energy  for tens of millions of Americans all while lowering America's deficit.  The Administration has taken action to eliminate junk fees, unsnarl pandemicdriven  supply  chain  bottlenecks  that  increased prices,  and  promote  greater  competition  across the American  economy.    The Budget  builds on  this  record  of  progress  through  additional proposals  to  continue  lowering  everyday  costs for the American people-from health insurance

and prescription drugs, to higher education and housing, to utilities and child care.

Lowers  Healthcare  Costs. The  President believes that healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.  With enrollment in affordable health coverage at an all-time high, the Budget builds on  the  success  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act  by making permanent the expanded premium tax credits that the Inflation Reduction  Act extended.    The  Budget  also  provides  Medicaidlike coverage to individuals in States that have not  adopted  Medicaid  expansion,  paired  with financial  incentives  to  ensure  States  maintain their existing expansions.

Reduces Drug and other Healthcare Costs for  All  Americans. The  Budget  builds  upon the Inflation Reduction Act to continue lowering the  cost  of  prescription  drugs.    For  Medicare, this  includes  further  strengthening  its  newly established negotiation power  by  negotiating more drugs and bringing drugs into negotiation

sooner after  they  launch.    The  Budget  also  proposes to  limit  Medicare  Part  D  cost-sharing  for  highvalue generic drugs, such as certain generic drugs used for chronic conditions like hypertension and high cholesterol, to no more than $2.  For Medicaid, the Budget includes proposals to ensure Medicaid and  the  Children's  Health  Insurance  Program (CHIP) are prudent purchasers of prescriptions drugs,  such  as  authorizing  the  Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate supplemental drug rebates on behalf of interested States  in  order  to  pool  purchasing  power.    For the  commercial  market,  the  Budget  includes proposals  to  curb  inflation  in  prescription  drug prices and cap the prices of insulin products at $35 for a monthly prescription.

Expands Access to Affordable, HighQuality  Early  Child  Care  and  Learning. The  Budget  advances  the  President's  goal  of ensuring that all families can access affordable, high-quality  child  care  and  free,  high-quality preschool, helping children learn, giving families breathing room, and growing the economy.  The President's plan enables States to increase child care  options  for  more  than  16  million  young children  and  lower  costs  so  that  parents  can afford to send their children to the high-quality child care program of their choice, allowing them to go to work or pursue training with the peace of mind that their children are being set up for a lifetime of success.

The Budget also funds a Federal-State partnership that provides high-quality, universal, free preschool, offered in the setting of a parent's choice-from public schools to child care providers  to  Head  Start-to  support  healthy child  development  and  ensure  children  enter kindergarten  ready  to  succeed.    The  proposal enables States to increase preschool access and quality.    The  Budget  provides  access  to  highquality  preschool  to  all  of  the  approximately four million four-year-old children in the Nation, and gives States the flexibility to expand preschool  to  three-year-olds  after  preschool  is available to all four-year-olds.  The estimated cost of these child care and preschool investments is $600 billion over 10 years.

For 2024, the Budget also provides $22.1 billion for HHS's  existing  early  care  and  education programs,  an  increase  of  $2.1  billion  over  the 2023 enacted level.  This includes $9 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, an increase of nearly $1 billion over the 2023 enacted level, to expand access to quality, affordable child care for families across the Nation.  The Budget helps young children enter kindergarten ready to learn by providing $13.1 billion for Head Start, an increase of $1.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level. In addition, the Budget includes $500 million for a  demonstration program in the Department of education to create or expand free, high-quality preschool in school or community-based settings, including  Head  Start,  for  children  eligible  to attend Title I schools.

Increases  Affordable  Housing  Supply  to Reduce Costs. To address the critical shortage of affordable housing in communities throughout the  Nation,  the  Budget  includes  $59  billion  in mandatory funding and tax incentives aimed at increasing  the  affordable  housing  supply.    The Budget  also  includes  $10  billion  in  mandatory funding to incentivize State, local, and regional jurisdictions to make progress in removing barriers to affordable housing developments, such as restrictive zoning.  These investments would increase  the  development  of  affordable  rental and owner-occupied housing, including units affordable to extremely low-income families.  By expanding the supply of housing, the Budget would help curb cost growth across the broader housing market.  The Budget also provides $1.8 billion for the  HOMe  Investment  Partnerships  Program (HOMe),  an  increase  of  $300  million  over  the 2023 enacted level, to construct and rehabilitate affordable rental housing and provide homeownership  opportunities.    In  addition,  the Budget  provides  $258  million  to  support  2,200 units  of  new  permanently  affordable  housing specifically for the  elderly  and  persons  with disabilities, supporting the Administration's priority to maximize independent living for people with disabilities; and $459 million for the U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture's  (USDA)  rural housing  programs  to  increase rural housing opportunities, reduce rent burdens for low-income

rural tenants, and also increase the resiliency of rural housing to the impacts of climate change.  In addition, the Budget includes $3.4 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program to  help  communities  modernize  infrastructure, invest  in  economic  development,  create  parks and  other  public  amenities,  and  provide  social services.

Reduces Costs for Homeowners and Expands Access to Homeownership. To make homeownership more affordable for underserved borrowers, including first-time, low- to moderateincome,  and  minority  homebuyers,  the  Federal Housing  Administration  (FHA)  is  reducing  the annual mortgage insurance premiums new borrowers  will  pay  by  about  one-third,  saving the  average  FHA  borrower  approximately  $800 in  the  first  year  of  their  mortgage  loan  and providing continued savings for the duration of the  loan.    The  Budget  also  reflects  a  reduction in mortgage insurance fees for Native American borrowers in the Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program, which would save borrowers over $500 on average in their first year.  To assist rural lowincome homeowners, the Budget includes a new proposal  to  eliminate  the  existing  low-income borrower penalty that requires individuals to repay subsidy costs for USDA's SingleFamily  Direct  loans.   The  Budget  also  includes $10 billion in mandatory funding for a new FirstGeneration  Down  Payment Assistance  program to help address racial and ethnic homeownership and  wealth  gaps,  as  well  as  $100  million  for  a HOMe down payment assistance pilot to expand homeownership opportunities for first-generation and/or  low-wealth  first-time  homebuyers  and $15  million  to  increase  the  availability  of  FHA small balance mortgages.

Expands Access to Affordable Rent through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. The HCV program currently provides  2.3  million  low-income  families  with rental assistance to obtain housing in the private market.   The  Budget  provides  $32.7  billion,  an increase  of  $2.4  billion  (including  emergency funding) over the 2023 enacted level, to maintain services for all currently assisted families

and to expand assistance to an additional 50,000 households, particularly those who are experiencing homelessness  or  fleeing, or attempting  to  flee,  domestic  violence  or  other forms  of  gender-based  violence.    The  Budget further  expands  assistance  to  another  130,000 households  with  funding  from  HCV  program reserves.  To further ensure that more households have access to  safe  and  affordable  housing,  the Budget  includes  mandatory  funding  to  support two populations that are particularly vulnerable to homelessness-youth aging out of foster care and  extremely  low-income  (eLI)  veterans.   The Budget provides $9 billion to establish a housing voucher program for all 20,000 youth aging out of foster care annually, and provides $13 billion to  incrementally  expand  rental  assistance  for 450,000  eLI  veteran  families,  paving  a  path  to guaranteed  assistance  for  all  who  have  served the Nation and are in need.  In all, the Budget proposes to expand assistance to well over 200,000 additional households.

Improves College Affordability and Expands Free Community College. To  help lowand middle-income students overcome financial  barriers  to  postsecondary  education, the Budget proposes to increase the discretionary maximum Pell Grant by $500, expanding access to  the  grant  to  reach  over  6.8  million  students with money for college.  This request builds on successful bipartisan efforts to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $900 over the past two years, and creates a path to double the award by  2029.    The  Budget  also  invests  mandatory funding to expand free community college across the  Nation.    To  lay  the  groundwork  for  this program,  the  Budget  includes  $500  million  in a  new  discretionary  grant  program  to  provide two-years of free community college for students enrolled in high-quality programs  that lead to  a  four-year  degree  or  a  good  paying  job.    In addition, the Budget provides mandatory funding for  two  years  of  subsidized  tuition  for  students from families earning less than $125,000 enrolled in  a  four-year  Historically  Black  College  and University  (HBCU), Tribally  Controlled  College and University (TCCU), or Minority-Serving Institution (MSI).

Lowers  Home  Energy  and  Water  Costs. The Budget provides $4.1 billion, a $111 million increase from the 2023 enacted level (excluding emergency appropriations),  for  the  Low  Income Home  energy  Assistance  Program  (LIHeAP). Since the  Low  Income  Household  Water  Assistance Program (LIHWAP) expires at the end of 2023, the Budget proposes to increase LIHeAP funding and  allow  States  the  option  to  use  a  portion of  their  LIHeAP  funds  to  provide  water  bill assistance to low-income households. The Budget builds on the $13 billion provided in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce energy bills for families, expand  clean  energy, transform  rural power production, and create thousands of good-paying jobs for people across rural America.  The Budget provides $30 million for grants and $1 billion for loan  guarantees  for  renewable  energy  systems and energy efficiency improvements for farmers and rural small businesses.

Moves Goods More Quickly through the Nation's Ports and Waterways. The  Budget continues support for modernizing  America's port and waterway infrastructure initiated under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-helping further  address  cost  pressures.    The  Budget includes $230 million for the Port Infrastructure Development  Program  to  strengthen  maritime freight  capacity.    In  addition  to  keeping  the Nation's supply chain moving  by improving efficiency, the Department of Transportation (DOT)  will  prioritize  projects  that  also  lower emissions-reducing  environmental  impact  in and around the Nation's ports.

ongoing actions to develop more diverse, robust, and  resilient  local  and  regional  supply  chains by targeting funding to increase the production capacity among  smaller  producers, including continuing overtime user fee relief for small and very  small  meat  and  poultry  establishments  as established  in  the American  Rescue  Plan.   The Budget complements these targeted investments by strengthening market oversight through the  Agricultural  Marketing  Service  to  support fair  markets  and  competitive  meat  and  poultry product prices for American families and increasing safeguards against invasive pests and zoonotic diseases through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

Fosters Competitive and Productive Markets  and  Targets  Corporate  Concentration. Vigorous marketplace  competition through robust enforcement of antitrust law can help reduce costs and raise wages.  The Budget advances  this  effort  by  including  a  historic increase of $100 million over the 2023 enacted level for the Department  of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division.  The President also supports legislation that would align executives' interests with  the  long-term  interests  of  shareholders, workers, and the economy by requiring executives  to  hold  on  to  company  shares  that they  receive  for  several  years  after  receiving them, and prohibiting them from selling shares in the years after a stock buyback.  This would discourage corporations from using profits to repurchase stock and enrich executives, rather than investing in long-term growth and innovation.

Builds and Protects a Fair and Resilient Food  Supply  Chain. The  Budget  supports

## PROTECTING AND STRENGTHENING MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY

The President has always believed that Medicare  and  Social  Security  are  a  promise-a rock-solid guarantee-that generations of Americans have counted on to be able to retire with dignity and security.  As the President has

made clear, he will reject any efforts to cut the Medicare or Social Security benefits that seniors and  people  with  disabilities  have  earned  and paid into their entire working lives.  The Budget honors  that  ironclad  commitment-not  only  by

firmly  opposing  benefit  cuts  to  either  program, but  by  embracing  reforms  that  would  protect and strengthen both programs.  The President is committed to working with the Congress to ensure Medicare and Social Security remain strong for their beneficiaries, now and in the future.

Protects and Strengthens Medicare. The Budget  would  extend  the  solvency  of  the  HI trust fund by at least 25 years, without cutting any  benefits,  or  raising  costs  for  people  with Medicare.   The  Budget  includes  key  reforms  to the  tax  code  to  ensure  high-income  individuals pay their fair share into the HI trust fund.  The Budget  also  directs  the  revenue  from  the  Net Investment Income Tax into the HI trust fund as was originally intended.   In addition, the Budget directs  the  savings  from  the  Budget's  proposed drug reforms into the HI trust fund.

Protects the Social Security Benefits that Americans Have Earned. The Administration is  committed  to  protecting  and  strengthening

Social  Security  and  opposes  any  attempt to  cut Social  Security  benefits  for  current  or  future recipients.    The  Administration  looks  forward to  working  with  the  Congress  to  responsibly strengthen  Social Security by ensuring  that high-income individuals pay their fair share.  In addition,  the  Administration  looks  forward  to improving  the  Supplemental  Security  Income program to help low-income older Americans and people with disabilities afford their basic needs.

The Budget also invests  in  staff,  information technology, and other improvements at the Social Security Administration (SSA), providing an increase  of  $1.4  billion,  a  10-percent  increase from the 2023 enacted level.  These funds would improve  customer  service  at  SSA's  field  offices, State disability determination services, and teleservice centers for retirees, individuals with disabilities, and their families.  The Budget also adds staff to process more disability claims and reduce the amount of time claimants have to wait for decisions on vital benefits.

## INVESTING IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STRENGTH

The President's economic strategy is producing results for the  American  people.    Since  the President took office, the economy has added more than 12 million new jobs-including more than 800,000 manufacturing jobs-the unemployment rate is at the lowest level in 54 years, and the last two years were the strongest two years for small business applications on record.  The President's plan is rebuilding America's infrastructure, promoting  workers,  making  the  economy  more competitive,  and  fueling  a  manufacturing  boom that  is  strengthening  parts  of  the  Nation  that have  long  been  left  behind  while  creating  good jobs for workers, including those without college degrees.    The  Budget  builds  on  this  record  of economic progress through additional proposals to  continue  fueling  a  resurgence  in  American manufacturing  and  investing  in  infrastructure, supporting workers and entrepreneurs, improving education, and expanding access to housing.

Boosting American Manufacturing and Investing in Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies

Continues Implementation of the President's Historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Implementation of President's historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already well underway.    The  Budget  builds  on  this progress by providing a total of $76.1 billion for highway,  highway  safety,  and  transit  formula programs,  supporting  the  amounts  authorized for  year  three  of  the  Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law.  This includes $60.1 billion for the FederalAid Highway program, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to 2023 enacted, to continue repairing and upgrading the Nation's highways and bridges and  build  out  a  national  network  of  electric vehicle  chargers  to  help  reach  the  President's climate goals-as well as $14 billion to support

transit agencies across the Nation.  The Budget also provides $4.6 billion for DOT to advance the Nation's most urgent and complex transportation infrastructure  projects,  in  conjunction  with  the significant resources provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  These funds would support transformational  projects  that  would  increase safety, improve mobility for commuters  and freight traffic, and spur shared economic growth.    Building  on  the  $1  billion  provided  in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  for 2024 for operating and maintaining Army  Corps of engineers-Civil  Works  program's  (Corps) infrastructure, the Budget invests in the Corps' continued operations, maintenance, and improved reliability.

Tackles 21 st  Century Aviation Challenges. The Budget provides $16.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Federal Aviation Administration.    This  funding  would  continue the hiring and  training surge of air traffic controllers started in 2023 to rebuild the pipeline of new controllers needed to meet projected traffic demands.  The Budget increases investment in the facilities and systems that comprise the National Airspace  System  (NAS)  by  over  $500  million to $3.5 billion, to address  maintenance  and modernization and to ensure the NAS continues to safely accommodate the growth in traditional commercial aviation traffic alongside new entrants from the commercial space, unmanned aircraft,  and  advanced  air  mobility  industries. The Budget also includes continued investment in  FAA's  multiyear  effort  of  reforming  aircraft certification, as  well  as  increasing  its  safety oversight capabilities.

Invests in American Manufacturing. To build  on  the  ongoing  resurgence  of  American manufacturing, the Budget provides $375 million for  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and Technology's (NIST) Industrial Technology Services,  a  $163  million  increase  above  the 2023 enacted level.  This includes a $98 million increase to Manufacturing  USA  to  support the  progress  of  NIST's  existing  manufacturing institute,  funding  for  a  new  institute  to  be launched in 2023, and $60 million to be awarded

competitively across the Government-wide network of manufacturing institutes to promote domestic production of institute-developed technologies.  The Budget includes $277 million, a  $102  million  increase  over  the  2023  enacted level, for the Manufacturing extension Partnership,  a  public-private  partnership  with centers in every State that offers advisory services to an increasingly diverse set of small and  medium  enterprises  so  they  can  thrive  in the  global  economy.   The  Budget  also  includes funding to help strengthen U.S. global leadership in the technologies of the future by accelerating the development of key technologies and establishing dynamic, collaborative networks for research and innovation.

Strengthens U.S. Leadership in Emerging Technologies. The Budget provides $25 billion, an increase of approximately $6.5 billion from the 2023 enacted level, for CHIPS and Science Actauthorized activities.  This includes $11.3 billion at the National Science Foundation (NSF), $8.8 billion at the Department of energy's (DOe) Office of Science, $1 billion at NIST and $4 billion at  the  Department  of  Commerce's  (Commerce) economic  Development  Administration  (eDA). These  investments  include  $1.2  billion  for  the CHIPS  and  Science  Act-authorized  Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and  Partnerships within  NSF  to  help  accelerate  and  translate scientific  research  into  innovations,  industries, and jobs. The Directorate will work with programs  across  the  Agency  and  with  other Federal  and  non-Federal  entities  to  expedite technology development in emerging areas that are crucial for U.S. technological leadership. The  Budget  provides  $300  million  to  invest  in NSF's  Regional  Innovation  engines  program, bringing  together  State  and  local  governments, institutions  of  higher  education,  labor  unions, businesses, and community-based organizations across the Nation to galvanize use-inspired research,  technology  translation,  and  workforce development.    Within  DOe's  Office  of  Science, the  Budget  supports  cutting-edge  research  at the  national  laboratories  and  universities  and building and operating world-class scientific user facilities  and  the  largest  investment  in  fusion

energy in history.  The Budget requests more than $4 billion at  eDA to fund grants that enable the growth  of  Regional  Technology  and  Innovation Hubs Program that foster the geographic diversity of innovation and create quality jobs in underserved and vulnerable communities across the Nation.

## Supporting Workers, Families, Entrepreneurs, and Small Businesses

Cuts Taxes for Families with Children and American Workers .  The Budget would expand key tax cuts benefitting lower- and middle-income workers  and  families.    The  President  is  calling for  the  restoration  of  the  full  Child  Tax  Credit enacted in the American Rescue Plan, which cut child poverty in half in 2021, to the lowest level in history.  The Budget would expand the credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child for children six years old and above, and to $3,600 per child for  children  under six.  In addition, the Budget would  permanently  reform  the  credit  to  make it fully refundable, so that it no longer excludes children in the lowest-income families, and allow families  to  receive  monthly  advance  payments. The President also calls on the Congress to make the  earned  Income  Tax  Credit  expansion  for childless workers permanent, which would help pull low-paid workers out of poverty.

Provides  National,  Comprehensive  Paid Family and Medical Leave. The vast majority of America's workers do not have access to paid family leave, including three out of four private sector workers.  Among the lowest-paid workers, who are predominately women and workers of color,  92  percent have no access to paid family leave  through  their  employers.    As  many  as one in five  retirees  leave  the  workforce  earlier than planned to care for an ill family member, which  negatively  impacts  families  as  well  as the Nation's labor supply and productivity. The  Budget  proposes  to  establish  a  national, comprehensive  paid  family  and  medical  leave program  administered  by  SSA.    The  program would:  provide workers with progressive, partial

wage replacement to take time off for family and medical  reasons;  include  robust  administrative funding;  and  use  an  inclusive  family  definition. The Budget would provide up to 12 weeks of leave to allow eligible workers to take time off to:  care for and bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one's  military  deployment;  or  find  safety  from domestic  violence,  sexual  assault,  or  stalking. The Budget would also provide up to three days of leave to grieve the death of a loved one.  The Administration  looks  forward  to  continuing  to work  with  the  Congress  to  make  this  critical investment and strengthen America's economy.

Calls for Paid Sick Leave for All Workers. Millions of workers in America have to  choose  between  a  needed  paycheck-or  even a  job-and  taking  care  of  a  family  member  or themselves when they are sick.  Workers without paid sick days are more likely to go to work when sick, send their child to school when sick, and do without  the  healthcare  they  need  to  get  better. Paid sick days are also good for business, leading to lower employee turnover, increased productivity, and reducing the spread of contagious diseases. The  President  calls  on  the  Congress  to  require employers  to  provide  seven  job-protected  paid sick  days  each  year  to  all  workers  and  ensure that employers cannot penalize workers for taking time off to address their health needs or the health needs of their families or to seek safety from  domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  sexual assault, or stalking.

Empowers  and  Protects  Workers. The Budget invests $2.3 billion, an increase of $430 million above the 2023 enacted level, in the  Department  of  Labor's  (DOL)  worker protection  agencies.    The  Budget  would  enable DOL  to  protect  workers'  wages  and  benefits, combat exploitative child labor, address the misclassification of workers as independent contractors,  and  improve  workplace  health  and safety.    The  Budget  also  provides  resources  to support  vigorous  enforcement  of  the  Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, especially where

employers  have  retaliated  against  or  otherwise penalized employees for taking federally protected leave from work.  Similarly, the Budget increases funding for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the equal employment Opportunity Commission  (eeOC),  to  help  level  the  playing field  for  workers,  protecting  their  right  to  fair representation  and  better  working  conditions and secure equal opportunity for workers from all walks of life.  The Budget would also strengthen the eeOC's steadfast enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to help protect the right of individuals with disabilities to full, equitable participation in the workplace.

Expands Penalties when Employers Violate Workers' Rights to Organize, Receive Fair  Wages,  and  Have  a  Safe  and  Healthy Workplace Free from Discrimination. employers often receive only a slap on the wristat  most-when  they  fire  or  retaliate  against workers for exercising their right to organize and collectively  bargain,  steal  wages  from  workers, force workers  to work  in unsafe conditions, exploit  children,  or  otherwise  flagrantly  violate the Nation's labor laws.  To deter employers from violating  workers'  rights,  ensure  those  who  do violate  their  rights  are  held  accountable,  and level the playing field for responsible employers, the Budget proposes instituting and meaningfully increasing penalties at DOL, eeOC, and NLRB for employers that violate workplace safety, health, wage and hour, child labor, equal opportunity, and labor organizing rules.

Expands Workforce Training that Provides  Pathways  to  Good  Jobs. The Budget invests in effective, evidence-based training models that would ensure all workersparticularly women, workers of color, those living in  rural  areas,  workers  with  disabilities,  and others underrepresented in growing fields-have the skills they need to compete for and secure good jobs.  The Budget provides $200 million for a new Sectoral  employment  through  Career  Training for  Occupational  Readiness  program  to  support the development and expansion of public-private partnerships between employers, education and training providers, and community-based groups

to equitably deliver high-quality training focused on growing  industries. The  Budget  invests $335  million,  a  $50  million  increase  above  the 2023 enacted level, in Registered Apprenticeship, an evidence-based earn-and-learn model that is a  critical  tool  for  training  future  workforces  in the  construction,  clean  energy,  semiconductor, transportation and logistics, education, and other growing and in-demand industries.  The Budget also invests $100 million, a $35 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, to build community colleges' capacity to work with the public workforce development system and employers to design and deliver high-quality training programs in communities across the Nation.

Modernizes,  Protects,  and  Strengthens Unemployment  Insurance  (UI). The UI program provides a critical safety net for workers who  have  lost  a  job  through  no  fault  of  their own, and helps protect the economy as a whole from further damage during downturns.  UI was critical in helping millions of Americans through unexpected job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, the pandemic also exposed vulnerabilities  in  the  program.    The  Budget invests $3.7 billion, an increase of $522 million above  the  2023  enacted  level,  to  modernize, protect,  and  strengthen  the  UI  program.    This includes  investments  aimed  at  tackling  fraud, including funding to support more robust identity verification for UI applicants, help States develop and  test  fraud-prevention  tools  and  strategies, and allow the DOL's Office of Inspector General to  increase  its  investigations  into  fraud  rings targeting  the  UI  program.    In  addition,  the Budget  proposes  a comprehensive  legislative package of program integrity proposals designed to  provide  States  with  new  tools  and  resources to combat  UI  fraud  and  improper  payments while  ensuring  equity  and  accessibility  for  all claimants.  The Budget also proposes principles to guide future efforts to reform the UI system, including  improving  benefit  levels  and  access, scaling UI benefits automatically during recessions,  expanding  eligibility  to  reflect  the modern labor force, improving State and Federal solvency through more equitable and progressive

financing, expanding reemployment services, and further safeguarding the program from fraud.

Broadens  Access  to  Capital  for  Small Businesses. The Budget supports historic lending levels across the 7(a), 504, Small Business Investment Company  (SBIC),  and Microloan programs.    The  nearly  $58  billion  in  lending provided in the Budget would address the need for greater access to affordable capital, particularly in underserved  communities.    Increasing  the authorized  lending  level  for  the  SBIC  program by  20  percent  to  $6  billion  would  significantly expand the availability of venture capital funding for small businesses.

Supports Minority-Owned  Business to Narrow  Racial  Wealth  Gaps. The  Budget increases the capacity of the Minority Business Development Agency by providing the full $110 million authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which would bolster services provided  to  minority-owned,  including  women of color-owned,  enterprises  by  expanding  the Business Center program, funding Rural Business  Centers,  opening  new  regional  offices, and  supporting  innovative  initiatives  to  foster economic resiliency.

## Making Historic Investments in Education

Invests in High-Poverty Schools. To  help ensure that every student receives a high-quality education, the Budget provides $20.5 billion for Title  I,  a  $2.2  billion  increase  above  the  2023 enacted  level.    This  funding  would  continue  historic progress over the past two years, as the Congress has  enacted  a  total  increase  of  $1.9  billion  for Title I since 2021.  Title I delivers critical funding to 90 percent of school districts across the Nation, helping them to provide students in low-income communities  the  academic  opportunities  and support they need to succeed.  This increase in funding addresses chronic funding gaps between high-poverty  schools-which  disproportionately serve students  of color-and  their  wealthier

counterparts  and  would  help  schools  sustain critical investments in accelerated learning and other areas that were made with American Rescue Plan funds.

Increases Support for Children with Disabilities. every  child with  a disability should  have  access  to  the  high-quality  early intervention, special education services, and personnel needed to thrive in school and graduate ready for college or a career.  The Budget invests $16.8  billion in Individuals  with  Disabilities education Act (IDeA) grants to support special education  and  related  services  for  more  than seven million students with disabilities in grades Pre-K  through  12,  an  increase  of  $2.1  billion above the 2023 enacted level.  The Budget also invests $932 million in IDeA Part C grants-an increase of $392 million above the 2023 enacted level-which support early intervention services for infants and families with disabilities that are critical  to  supporting  children's  developmental and academic outcomes.  The increased funding would support States in implementing important reforms  to  expand  enrollment  of  underserved children,  including  children  of  color,  children from low-income families, and children living in rural areas.  The Budget also includes funding to develop tools and programs to support children with  disabilities  in  military  families  and  other highly mobile populations.

Expands Institutional Capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and Community Colleges. The  Budget  increases  institutional capacity  at  HBCUs,  TCCUs,  MSIs,  and  underresourced institutions, including community colleges, by providing an increase of $429 million above  the  2023  enacted  level.    This  significant funding includes $350 million for four-year HBCUs, TCCUs,  and  MSIs  to  expand  research and development (R&amp;D) infrastructure at these institutions. These capacity enhancements complement the Budget's proposal for two years of  subsidized  tuition  for  students  from  families earning  less  than  $125,000  enrolled  in  a  fouryear HBCU, TCCU, or MSI.

## EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND STRENGTHENING PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE

Since the President took office:  a record-setting 16.3 million people signed up for health coverage through  the  Affordable  Care  Act;  the  national uninsured rate has hit an all-time low; and the Administration  has  taken  action  to  protect  millions of  consumers  from  surprise  medical  bills,  cap insulin prescriptions for Medicare beneficiaries at $35 per month, lower healthcare premiums, close the  'family  glitch'  loophole,  protect  American's access to reproductive healthcare, allow Medicare to  negotiate  for  lower  prescription  drug  prices, and supercharge efforts to end cancer as we know it.  The Budget expands on this progress through a package of proposals that would expand access to high-quality healthcare and strengthen America's public health infrastructure.

## Expanding Access to HighQuality Healthcare

Expands  Access  to  Quality,  Affordable Healthcare. The  Budget  invests  $150  billion over  10  years  to  improve  and  expand  Medicaid home  and  community-based  services,  such  as personal care services, which would allow older Americans  and  individuals  with  disabilities  to remain in  their  homes  and  stay  active  in  their communities  as  well  as  improve  the  quality  of jobs  for  home  care  workers  and  support  family caregivers.  Because community health centerswhich provide comprehensive services regardless of ability to pay-serve one in three people living in  poverty  and  one  in  five  rural  residents,  the Budget  puts  the  Health  Center  Program  on  a path to double its size and expand its reach.  To bolster  the  healthcare  workforce,  the  Budget expands  the  National  Health  Service  Corps, which provides loan repayment and scholarships to healthcare professionals in exchange for practicing in underserved areas, and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical education Program, which trains residents in communitybased healthcare clinics in rural and high need areas.  The Administration also looks forward to

working with the Congress on ways to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid through measures such as improving access to dental, hearing, and vision coverage.

Supports  Family  Planning  Services  for More Americans .  For more than 50 years, Title X family planning clinics have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of highquality  family  planning  and  preventive  health services.    Most  Title  X  clients  live  in  poverty and the uninsured rate of Title X users is twice the national average, making the Title X family planning  program  a  critical  part  of  the  public health  safety  net.    The  program  has  served  as a point of entry into care for nearly 195 million people over its more than 50-year history.  The Budget includes $512 million, a 79-percent increase  above  the  2023  enacted  level,  for  the Title X Family Planning program to increase the number of patients served to 4.5 million.

Advances  Maternal  Health  and  Health Equity. The  United  States  has  the  highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, and rates are disproportionately high for Black  and American  Indian  and Alaska  Native women.    The  Budget  includes  $471  million  to: support the ongoing implementation of the White House  Blueprint  for  Addressing  the  Maternal Health Crisis and to reduce maternal mortality and  morbidity  rates;  expand  maternal  health initiatives in rural communities; implement implicit  bias  training  for  healthcare  providers; create  pregnancy  medical  home  demonstration projects; and address the highest rates of perinatal health  disparities,  including  by  supporting  the perinatal  health  workforce.    In  addition,  the Budget requires all States to provide continuous Medicaid  coverage  for  12  months  postpartum, eliminating gaps in health insurance at a critical time.    To  address  the  lack  of  data  on  health disparities  and  further  improve  access  to  care, the Budget strengthens collection and evaluation of sociodemographic data.

Supports  Rural  Health. Rural  America faces persistent disparities in access to healthcare,  including  higher  uninsured  rates, limited healthcare provider availability, and rural  hospital  closures.    Providing  Medicaidlike coverage to individuals in States that have not adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, as the Budget proposes, is critical for rural communities.  The Budget also includes  investments  to  improve  the  health  of rural  communities,  including  by  helping  rural hospitals  stay  open,  expanding  the  pipeline  of rural healthcare workers, and facilitating access to quality care.  The Budget provides assistance to rural hospitals at-risk of closure and to support expansion of hospital service lines to meet rural communities'  needs.   The  Budget  also  supports rural healthcare workforce development  and training  programs  and  telehealth.    Recognizing that  rural  communities  have  higher  rates  of suicide,  and  high  rates  of  overdose  deaths  and mental  illness,  the  Budget  provides  dedicated funding  to  rural  communities,  including  rural health clinics, to support behavioral health. The  Budget  also  supports  the  financing  and infrastructure of rural healthcare through USDA's Rural Development Programs.

Guarantees Adequate and Stable Funding for  the  Indian  Health  Service  (IHS). The Administration  is  committed  to  upholding  the United States' trust  responsibility  to  tribal  nations by addressing the historical underfunding of IHS. The enactment of an advance appropriation for 2024  for  IHS  was  a  historic  and  welcome  step toward the goal of securing adequate and stable funding to improve the overall health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives.  Building on the advance appropriation, the Budget requests  an  additional  $3  billion  in  2024  for  a total  of  $8.1  billion  in  discretionary  resources. In addition, the Budget  reclassifies contract support costs and leases as mandatory for a total of  $9.4  billion  in  discretionary  and  mandatory resources in 2024.  The Budget proposes all IHS resources as mandatory beginning in 2025.

## Strengthening Public Health and Improving Health Outcomes

Advances  the  Cancer  Moonshot  Goals. The Cancer Moonshot Initiative aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the  next  25  years,  and  improve  the  experience of  people  who  are  living  with  or  have  survived cancer, their families, and caregivers.  Reaching these  goals  will  require  progress  in  ways  to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and ensure that the tools we have and those we develop along the way reach more Americans.  Investments across the Cancer Cabinet agencies would be targeted to priority actions including:  1) close the screening gap;  2)  understand  and  address  environmental exposure; 3) decrease the impact of preventable cancers;  4)  bring  cutting-edge  research  through the pipeline to patients and communities; and  5)  support  patients  and  caregivers.    The Budget includes $1 billion for dedicated Cancer Moonshot activities across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), IHS, the Health  Resources  and  Services  Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as  a  total  investment  at  the  National  Cancer Institute  (NCI)  of  $7.8  billion  to  drive  progress on  ways  to  prevent,  detect,  and  treat  cancer. In  addition,  the  Budget  proposes  to  increase mandatory funding for  the  21st  Century  Cures Act  Beau  Biden  Cancer  Moonshot  initiative  at NCI  through  2026.    The  Budget  also  provides an increase of $1 billion for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, for a total of $2.5 billion, to drive innovative health research and speed the implementation of breakthroughs that would transform the treatment, prevention, and early detection of cancer and other diseases. As  the  Administration  works  to  address  the single  biggest  driver  of  cancer  deaths  in  this Nation-smoking-the  Budget  also  includes  a total  investment  of  $257.5  million  in  tobacco prevention and control efforts at CDC, including tobacco  cessation  activities  to  help  Americans quit.

Transforms  Behavioral  Healthcare. The United  States  is facing a behavioral health crisis. Recently  enacted  legislation,  such  as the  Bipartisan  Safer  Communities  Act,  takes significant  steps  to  address  this  crisis  and  the Administration is implementing these behavioral health  and  school  mental  health  investments. Still, much more can be done.  Nearly one in four adults 18 and older, and one in three adults aged 18 to 25, had a mental illness in the past year.  Suicide is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  for  young people ages 10 to 24 and teen girls, in particular, are  experiencing  record  high  levels  of  violence, sadness, and suicide risk.  More than 46 million people  had  a  substance  use  disorder,  nearly  94 percent of whom did not receive treatment.  For people with private health insurance, the Budget expands coverage of mental health benefits and strengthens  the  network  of  behavioral  health providers.  For people with Medicare, the Budget lowers patients' costs for mental health services, requires  parity  in  coverage  between  behavioral health and medical benefits, and expands coverage for  behavioral  health  providers.    The  Budget provides  historic  investments  in  the  behavioral health workforce, youth mental healthcare, Certified  Community  Based  Behavioral  Health Clinics, Community Mental Health Centers, and mental health research.  The Budget strengthens access to crisis services by investing in the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to address 100 percent of estimated  contacts,  scaling  follow-up  crisis services, and expanding CDC's suicide prevention program to all States, the District of Columbia, and 18 tribal and territorial jurisdictions.

Prepares for Future Pandemics and Other Biological Threats. The United States must  catalyze  advances  in  science,  technology, and core capabilities to prevent and prepare for future  biological  threats,  which  could  emerge with increasing frequency.  The Budget includes $20 billion in mandatory funding for HHS public health agencies in support of the Administration's pandemic prevention and preparedness and biodefense  priorities  as  outlined  in  the  2021 American Pandemic Preparedness:  Transforming Our Capabilities plan and 2022 National Biodefense  Strategy  and  Implementation  Plan

for Countering  Biological  Threats,  Enhancing Pandemic  Preparedness,  and  Achieving  Global Health Security (National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan) .  The Budget also includes $400 million in new discretionary resources within the  Administration  for  Strategic  Preparedness and  Response  to  prepare  for  pandemics  and biological  threats,  as  well  as  key  discretionary investments for the Biomedical Advanced Research  and  Development  Authority  and  the Strategic National Stockpile to support advanced development and procurement of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic capabilities against known  and  unknown  high  priority  threats.    In addition, the Budget includes mandatory funding to  catalyze  development  of  drugs  that  address the pandemic threat of antimicrobial resistance. The Budget proposes key new HHS authorities to  improve  preparedness,  incorporating  lessons learned  from  recent  public  health  emergencies, such as to enhance the visibility and the resilience of the medical product supply chain.

Invests in the Treatment and Prevention of Infectious Diseases. The Budget invests in the treatment  and  prevention  of  infectious  diseases, including  Hepatitis  C,  HIV,  and  other  vaccinepreventable diseases, by supporting comprehensive programs that would expand access to curative and preventive  medications.    The  Budget  includes  a new mandatory proposal for a national program to significantly expand screening, testing, treatment, prevention, and monitoring of Hepatitis C infections  in  the  United  States,  with  a  specific focus  on  populations  with  high  infection  levels. This program would support Federal procurement of life-saving treatments, while bolstering provider capacity and related public health efforts such as testing,  communication,  and  surveillance.    The Budget invests $850 million in the ending the HIV epidemic  Initiative  across  HHS  to  aggressively reduce  new  HIV  cases,  increase  access  to  preexposure prophylaxis (also known as PreP), and ensure equitable access to services and support for those living with HIV.  The Budget also reduces Medicaid costs by eliminating barriers to accessing PreP for Medicaid beneficiaries and proposes a new mandatory program to:  guarantee PreP at no cost for  all  uninsured  and  underinsured  individuals;

provide  essential  wrap-around  services  through States,  IHS,  tribal  entities,  and  localities;  and establish  a  network  of  community  providers  to reach  underserved  areas  and  populations.    In addition, the Budget proposes a new Vaccines for Adults program to provide uninsured adults with access to routine and outbreak vaccines at no cost and expands the Vaccines for Children program to include all children under age 19 enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program.

Supports Survivors of Domestic Violence and Other Forms of Gender-Based Violence. The  Budget  proposes  significant  increases  to support  and  protect  survivors  of  gender-based violence,  including  $519  million  for  the  Family Violence Prevention and Services (FVPSA)

program to support domestic violence survivorsdouble  the  2023  enacted  level.    This  amount continues funding availability for FVPSA-funded resource  centers,  including  those  that  support the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and  Intersex  community.    The  Budget  would provide additional funding for domestic violence hotlines  and  cash  assistance  for  survivors  of domestic violence, as well as funding to support a demonstration project evaluating services for survivors at the intersection of housing instability, substance  use  coercion,  and  child welfare.  In addition, the Budget would provide over $66 million for victims of human trafficking and  survivors  of  torture,  an  increase  of  nearly $17 million from the 2023 enacted level.

## TAKING HISTORIC ACTION TO LOWER ENERGY PRICES, CREATING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS WHILE CONFRONTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS, AND PROTECTING CLEAN AIR AND WATER

Under the President's  leadership,  the  United States is leading the world in:  building a clean energy economy; tackling the climate crisis; creating clean energy jobs; protecting America's communities  from  climate  disasters;  advancing environmental  justice;  and  cutting  energy  bills for hard working families.  The Administration is continuing to implement the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-the largest investments that any country has made in clean energy, energy security, climate change, and clean air and water in history-which is already galvanizing the Nation's clean energy transition and making solar panels, energy efficient homes, and  electric  cars  more  affordable  for  American families.    The  Budget  invests  in  clean  energy  across America, bringing jobs to rural communities and cities, leaving no one behind.

Cutting Energy and Water Bills for American Families and Creating Clean Energy Jobs

Creates Jobs Building Clean Energy Infrastructure  and  Cuts  Energy  Cost  for American Families. Clean energy has become a  centerpiece  of  the  American  economy.    The Budget invests nearly $4.5 billion to create good paying jobs building clean infrastructure projects all across the Nation.  The Budget supports clean energy  workforce and  infrastructure projects across  the  Nation,  including:    $1.8  billion  to weatherize  and  retrofit  low-income  Americans' homes;  $83  million  to  electrify  tribal homes and  transition  tribal  colleges  and  universities to  renewable  energy;  and  $107  million  for  the Department of energy's Grid Deployment Office  to  support  utilities  and  State  and  local governments  in  building  a  grid  that  is  more secure, reliable, and resilient and that integrates increasing  levels  of  renewable  energy.    These investments, which complement and bolster the historic funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  and  Inflation  Reduction  Act,  would  create

high-quality jobs while driving progress toward the Administration's climate goals, including carbon  pollution-free  electricity  by  2035.    The Budget supports efforts at the Department of the Interior (DOI) to meet the Administration's goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and also provides $60 million to expand offshore wind permitting activities at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to allow NOAA to use the best available science to  help  meet  the  Administration's  deployment goal while protecting biodiversity and promoting sustainable ocean co-use.

Makes  Historic  Investments  in  CuttingEdge  Research  to  Advance  Clean  Energy Innovation. The Budget provides $16.5 billion to support  climate  science  and  clean  energy innovation.  The Budget proposes over $5.1 billion to fund a broad portfolio of research to improve understanding of the changing climate and inform adaptation and resilience measures across multiple agencies, including DOI, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Commerce, NSF, and others.  The Budget supports U.S. preeminence in developing innovative technologies  that  accelerate  the  transition  to  a clean  energy  economy  by  investing  more  than $11.3 billion.  To boost American innovation and reestablish American leadership in research and scientific discovery, the  Budget  also  provides a  historic  investment  of  $8.8  billion  for  DOe's Office of Science and $1.2 billion at NSF, advancing  toward  the  CHIPS  and  Science  Act authorizations to support:  global leadership in the technologies of the future; advancing the Nation's understanding of climate change; identifying and accelerating novel technologies for  clean energy; and positioning the U.S. to meet the demand for isotopes.  The Budget also includes $1 billion for fusion, the largest ever investment in the promise of a clean energy power source.

Cuts  Climate  Warming  Pollution. The Budget  invests  in  reducing  climate  warming pollution toward achieving the President's target to  cut  carbon  emissions  50  to  52  percent  by 2030.  These investments include an additional

$64.4  million  at  the  environmental  Protection Agency (ePA) to implement the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 and  continue  phasing  out  potent  greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons. The Budget supports $1.2 billion in DOe industrial decarbonization activities, including a DOe Industrial  Technologies  joint  strategy  team  to drive adoption of industrial decarbonization solutions, expanded  R&amp;D  efforts  in  the  new Industrial efficiency and Decarbonization Office, and $160 million to support at least two large-scale  industrial  decarbonization  projects directly  benefitting  disadvantaged  communities funded through the Office of Clean energy Demonstrations.

Accelerates American Manufacturing and Deployment of Clean Energy Technologies. The  Budget  also  includes  $75  million  for  the Department of energy to carry out the President's recent determinations under the Defense Production Act to enhance domestic supply chain capacity  for  key  climate  technologies.    To  build on  the  resurgence  of  American  manufacturing, the  Budget  complements  funding  provided  in the Inflation Reduction Act by providing robust support for Loan Program Office administrative expenses to originate and oversee the ambitious growth  in  the  financing  of  clean  energy  and advanced technology vehicle manufacturing projects envisioned in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Increases Permitting Capacity. The Budget invests  in  environmental  permitting  programs to expedite  delivery  of  new  and  modernized infrastructure.    The  Budget  also  proposes  to expand  existing  transfer  authority  by  enabling Federal agencies to transfer funds provided under the  Bipartisan  Infrastructure  Law  to  the  U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  and  NOAA  Fisheries to improve  efficiencies  and  increase  capacity for environmental  planning  and  consultation. Together with existing law, this proposal would accelerate  and  improve  environmental  reviews in support of responsible development of priority infrastructure projects and energy solutions.

## Strengthening Resilience

Bolsters Community Resilience to Climate  Change. The  Budget  invests  more than  $23  billion  for  climate  resilience  across DOI, USDA, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Defense (DOD).    These  investments  would  help  build communities'  resilience  to  floods,  wildfires,  and storms, improve conservation and ecosystem management, strengthen America's disaster response  capabilities,  increase  the  resiliency  of rural  housing  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change while  reducing  rent  burdens,  and  ensure  the resilience of the  Nation's  defense  to  climate change.    The  Budget  includes  $500  million  for flood hazard mapping, including the development of new data to support future flood conditions, as well as funding to sustain the Civilian Climate Corps.    The  Budget's  investments  complement historic  funding  provided  for  climate  resilience through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.

Strengthens  Conservation. The  Budget supports efforts to restore, conserve, and protect the natural world.  The Budget:  invests significant  resources  across  the  six  key  focus areas  in  the  America  the  Beautiful  Initiative; invests  in  providing  greenspace  in  underserved communities; supports tribal co-stewardship and co-management; and supports the first-ever national  nature  assessment.    The  Budget  also provides $26 million to develop the Conservation and Stewardship Atlas, which would help inform conservation decisions.  The Budget also provides nearly $1.2 billion to increase conservation adoption  across  privately  owned  land  through the Natural  Resources  Conservation  Service. These investments complement the historic funding  provided  for  restoration,  conservation and protection of public lands and waters through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, Great American Outdoors Act,  National  Parks  and  Public  Land Legacy Restoration  Fund,  and  Land  and Water Conservation Fund.

Strengthens the Nation's Frontline Defenses against Catastrophic Wildfires and Provides Long-Term Investments in the Wildland Firefighting Workforce. As both the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires are expected to increase due to climate change, the  Budget  provides  for  critical  mitigation  and response efforts and invests in America's Federal wildland  firefighting  workforce.    The  Budget invests in the Federal wildland firefighting workforce by ensuring that no Federal wildland firefighter makes less than $15 an hour and by creating  a  new  comprehensive  and  equitable compensation structure.  In addition, the Budget increases the size of the workforce and supports additional mental and physical health services for the workforce.  Together, these efforts would help address long-standing recruitment and retention challenges, build upon the historic reforms in the Bipartisan  Infrastructure  Law,  and  ensure  that  the workforce receives the enhanced support it needs to  continue  meeting  evolving  mission  demands. The Budget provides the USDA $323 million to support  ongoing  implementation  of  the  10-year Wildfire  Crisis  Strategy to  increase  the  scale  of fuel and  restoration  treatments  within  highrisk  'firesheds'  as  part  of  the  Administration's comprehensive, nationwide response to the threat of catastrophic  wildfire to natural  resources, communities,  and  infrastructure.    The  Budget also provides $314 million for DOI to help reduce the  risk  and  severity  of  wildfires  through  fuels management  and  restore  lands  devastated  by catastrophic fire.

Increases  Resilience  to  the  Effects  of Drought. The Budget helps ensure communities across  the  West  have  access  to  a  resilient  and reliable water supply by investing in rural water projects, water conservation, development of desalination  technologies,  and  water  recycling and  reuse  projects.    The  Budget  complements the  nearly  $1.7  billion  provided  in  2024  for western water infrastructure through the Bipartisan  Infrastructure  Law,  as  well  as  the nearly  $4.6  billion  that  was  provided  by  the Inflation  Reduction Act  for  drought  mitigation and domestic water supply projects through the Bureau  of  Reclamation.    The  Budget  provides

funding  to  address  the  ongoing  drought  in  the western  United  States,  including  funding  for WaterSMART,  Central  Valley  Project  drought activities,  and  implementation  funding  for  the Drought Contingency Plans to conserve water in the Colorado River System, which is at historically low levels.  The Budget also requests new funding at DOe to invest in desalination.

Invests  in  Flood  Risk  Management  and Mitigation .    The Budget invests in programs that help  communities  address  the  risks  associated with floods.  Investments include over $1 billion for the Corps to address coastal and inland flood risks and $175 million for flood mitigation grants through  the  Federal  emergency  Management Agency (FeMA).

## Protecting Clean Air and Water While Advancing Environmental Justice and Delivering for Communities Left Behind

Advances Equity and Environmental Justice. The Administration continues to prioritize efforts to deliver environmental justice in  communities  across  the  United  States,  including meeting the President's Justice40 commitment to ensure at least 40 percent of the benefits of Federal investments  in  climate  and  clean  energy  reach disadvantaged communities, including rural and tribal  communities.   The  Budget  bolsters  these efforts  by  investing  nearly  $1.8  billion  across ePA to support creating high-quality jobs, clean up  pollution,  advance  racial  equity,  and  secure environmental justice for communities that bear the brunt of toxic pollution and impacts of climate change.   The Budget provides ePA $246 million for civil enforcement efforts, which includes funding to  increase  enforcement  efforts  in  communities with high pollution exposure. The Budget provides DOe with $66 million to implement the Department's  Justice40  efforts  and  strengthen the Department's environmental justice mission, including $54 million for the Office of economic Impact and Diversity and $12 million for Legacy Management.    It  also  provides  $70  million  for Community Capacity Building initiatives in the  Office  of  environmental  Management  and

the  National  Nuclear  Security  Administration (NNSA)  for  areas  of  persistent  poverty  around the  Department's  sites,  and  $50  million  for  the newly established Office of State and Community energy Programs to launch a new energy Burden Reduction  Pilot  to  retrofit  low-income  homes with efficient electric appliances and systems.  In addition, the Budget invests $35 million for the Corps  in  technical  and  planning  assistance,  in 23 studies, and in the construction of 33 projects to  help  disadvantaged  and  tribal  communities address their water resources challenges in line  with  the  President's  Justice40  Initiativeincluding  funding  for  the  Tribal  Partnership Program.

Supports the President's Goal of Accelerating  the  Replacement  of  All  Lead Pipes and Upgrades the Nation's Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure. The Budget provides ePA $219 million for two grants dedicated to remediating lead contamination in water-Reducing  Lead  in  Drinking  Water  and Lead Testing in School and Child Care Program Drinking Water-an increase of $163 million over the  2023  enacted  level.   The  Budget  also  funds other grants and loans that can be used for lead service  line  replacements.   The  Budget  updates the  cross-Government  Lead  Pipe  Replacement Funding  Inventory  that  was  published  for  the first  time  with  the  2023  Budget.    The  Budget also provides ePA more than $4 billion for water infrastructure,  an  increase  of  $1  billion  over the  2023  enacted  level.   These  resources  would advance  efforts  to  upgrade  drinking  water  and wastewater infrastructure nationwide, with a focus on decreasing health disparities in underserved  and  rural  communities  that  have historically been overlooked.

Supports  Legacy  Energy  Communities. To  address  changes  in  the  energy  economy,  the Budget continues to invest in strategic planning, partnership development, and training and reemployment  activities  for  displaced  workers. The Budget provides $20 million to support the Department of Labor's role in the multi-agency Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and economic Revitalization  (also  known  as  POWeR+)

Initiative, which aims to assist displaced workers and transform local economies and communities transitioning  away  from  fossil  fuel  production to new, sustainable  industries. The  Budget also  includes  $67  million  for  the  Department of  Labor's  (DOL)  Workforce  Opportunities  for Rural  Communities,  a  program-administered in  partnership  with  the  Appalachian  Regional Commission,  the  Delta  Regional Authority,  and the Northern Border Regional Commission-that aims  to  help  these  communities  develop  local and  regional  workforce  development  strategies that  promote  long-term  economic  stability  and opportunities for workers, especially those connected to the energy industry.

Reduces Health and Environmental Hazards  for  At-Risk  Communities. The Budget includes $8.3 billion for DOe's environmental Management program to support the  cleanup  of  communities  used  during  the Manhattan  Project  and  Cold  War  for  nuclear weapons production.  The Budget also provides $196 million for the Office of Legacy Management to ensure cleanup remedies at these sites remain protective of human health and the environment. The Budget also provides $356 million for ePA's Superfund  program  to  continue  cleaning up some  of  the  Nation's  most  contaminated  land and respond to environmental emergencies and natural disasters, as part of a cancer prevention strategy.  In addition, an estimated $2.5 billion in Superfund tax revenue would be available to ePA in 2024.  The Administration would ensure that investments  for  the  cleanup  of  legacy  pollution support the Justice40 Initiative to benefit disadvantaged communities.

Tackles Perand Polyfluoroalkyl Substances  (PFAS)  Pollution. PFAS  are  a set  of  man-made  chemicals  that  threaten  the health  and  safety  of  communities  across  the Nation, disproportionately impacting historically disadvantaged  communities.    To  tackle  PFAS pollution, the  Budget  provides  approximately $170 million, $44 million over the 2023 Budget request,  for  ePA  to  continue  working  toward commitments made in the 2021 PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA's Commitments to Action 2021-2024 , including: increasing America's knowledge  of  PFAS  impacts  to  human  health and ecological effects; restricting use to prevent PFAS from entering the air, land, and water; and remediating PFAS that have been released into the environment.

## Doubling Down on America's Global Climate Leadership

Increases Global Energy Security, Infrastructure, and Resilience. The  Budget supports  the  President's  pledge  to:    more  than quadruple  international climate finance; and request more than $3 billion for the President's Emergency  Plan  for  Adaptation  and  Resilience (PREPARE) . This includes a $1.6 billion contribution  to  the  Green  Climate  Fund  and  a $1.2 billion loan to the Clean Technology Fund. The  Budget  also  advances  new  tools,  such  as loan  guarantees,  to  reassert  U.S.  leadership  in the Indo-Pacific by financing energy security and infrastructure projects and reducing reliance on volatile energy supplies and prices.  The Budget also  builds  resilience  to  better  prepare  for  and respond  to  extreme  weather  events  and  other disasters.

## ADVANCING EQUITY, SECURITY, AND OPPORTUNITY, AND STRENGTHENING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY

From  the  start  of  the  Administration,  the President  has  been  focused  on  strengthening America's  democracy,  expanding  opportunities for all Americans and making  communities

more  safe,  just,  and  equitable.    The  President signed  a  Day  One  executive  Order  to  promote equity across the Federal Government, increased  Federal  contract  dollars  flowing  to

small  disadvantaged  businesses,  made  historic investments in HBCUs,  TCCUs, and MSIs, invested  in  community  policing,  and  bolstered civil  rights  enforcement.    The  Administration reaffirmed  this  commitment  to  equity  through a  second  executive  Order,  issued  earlier  this year, that builds on these successes.  Last year, the President signed the first significant piece of legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence in  30  years,  the  Bipartisan  Safer  Communities Act,  which  is  now  being  implemented  across Government. In addition to proving that democracy can deliver for the American people, the President has secured key reforms to bolster U.S.  democratic  institutions,  including  signing into law the bipartisan electoral Count Reform Act  of  2022.    The  Budget  continues  to  advance these goals by tackling crime, making America's communities safer, reforming the criminal justice system, advancing equity and opportunity for  all  Americans,  delivering  results  for  tribal communities, and making robust investments to strengthen America's democracy.

## Making America's Communities Safer by Preventing, Reducing, and Combating Crime

Invests  in  Federal  Law  Enforcement  to Combat  Gun  Violence  and  Other  Violent Crime. The  Budget makes robust investments to bolster Federal law  enforcement  capacity. The  Budget  includes  $17.8  billion,  an  increase of $1.2  billion  above  the  2023  enacted  level, for DOJ  law  enforcement,  including a total of  nearly  $2  billion  for  the  Bureau  of  Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms,  and  explosives  to  expand multijurisdictional  gun  trafficking  strike  forces with  additional  personnel,  increase  regulation of the  firearms  industry,  and  implement  the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  The Budget includes $1.9 billion for the U.S. Marshals Service to support personnel dedicated to fighting violent crime,  including  through  fugitive  apprehension and  enforcement  operations.    The  Budget  also provides  $51  million  to  the  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation  (FBI)  to  support  the  continued implementation of enhanced background checks

required  by  the  Bipartisan  Safer  Communities Act.  In addition, the Budget provides a total of $2.9 billion for the U.S. Attorneys, which includes 130 new positions to support the prosecution of violent crimes.

Supports  State,  Local,  and  Tribal  Law Enforcement and Public Safety. The Budget provides  $4.9  billion  in  discretionary  resources for  State  and  local  grants  and  $30  billion  in mandatory  resources  to  support  States,  local, and tribal efforts to protect U.S. communities and promote public safety.  This includes $537 million for the COPS  Hiring  Program  discretionary topline, an increase of $213 million or 66 percent over  the  2023  enacted  level.    The  Budget  also includes $717 million, an $86 million increase, in Tribal Public Safety and Justice funding at DOI.

Reinvigorates Federal Civil Rights Enforcement. In order to address longstanding inequities and strengthen civil rights protections, the Budget invests $252 million, an increase of $62  million  over  the  2023  enacted  level,  in  the DOJ  Civil  Rights  Division.    These  resources would support police reform via pattern-orpractice  investigations,  the  prosecution  of  hate crimes, enforcement of voting rights, and efforts to provide equitable access to justice.

Prioritizes  Efforts  to  End  Gender-Based Violence. The  Budget  proposes  $1  billion  to support  implementation  of  programs  through the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA), which was  recently  reauthorized  and  strengthened in  2022.    This  is  a  $300  million  or  43-percent increase over the 2023 enacted level, which was the highest funding level in history.  The Budget supports  substantial  increases  for  longstanding VAWA  programs,  including  key  investments  in legal assistance for victims, transitional housing, and sexual assault services.  The Budget strongly supports  underserved  and  tribal  communities by  providing  $35  million  for  culturally-specific services, $10 million for underserved populations, $15 million to assist enforcement of tribal special domestic violence jurisdiction, and $3 million to support  tribal  Special Assistant  U.S. Attorneys. The Budget also provides $14 million to address

technological abuse through funding new VAWA programs to address cybercrimes against individuals.    In  addition,  the  Budget  provides $120  million,  an  increase  of  $65  million  above the  2023  enacted  level,  to  the  Office  of  Justice Programs for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative to address the rape kit backlog, and for the Regional Sexual Assault Investigative Training Academies Program.

Reforms  the  Federal  Criminal  Justice System. The Budget leverages the capacity of the Federal justice system to advance criminal justice reform initiatives and serve as a model for reform that  is  comprehensive,  evidence-informed,  and high-impact to enhance public safety and advance equity.  The Budget supports key investments in First  Step  Act  of  2018  (FSA)  implementation, including the continuation and expansion of the historic collaboration  between  the  Bureau  of Prisons (BOP) and DOL for a national initiative to provide comprehensive, intensive, and marketdriven workforce development services and reentry  to  people  in  the  Federal  prison  system, both during their time in BOP facilities and after they are transferred to community placement.  In total, the Budget continues to invest $409 million in  base  resources  for  FSA  implementation,  to support rehabilitative programming, improve conditions  of  confinement,  and  hire  additional FSA-dedicated programmatic staff.  The Budget also invests $300 million to support the first year of  a  new  10-year  Accelerating  Justice  System Reform program, with a total of $14.7 billion in mandatory funding requested over the following nine years.   This  program  would  provide  State, local,  and  tribal  governments  with  additional resources for crime prevention.

Reforms  the  Juvenile  Justice  System. The  Budget  proposes  $760  million  for  juvenile justice programs, an increase of $360 million over the  2023  enacted  level,  to  bolster  diversionary juvenile justice strategies.

Counters Cyber  Threats. The Budget expands  DOJ's  ability  to  pursue  cyber  threats through investments that support efforts to build cyber investigative capabilities at FBI

field  divisions  nationwide.    These  investments include an additional $63 million for more agents, enhanced response capabilities, and strengthened intelligence  collection  and  analysis  capabilities. These investments are in line with the National Cybersecurity Strategy that emphasizes a wholeof-Nation  approach  to  addressing  the  ongoing cyber threat.

## Expanding Opportunity, Advancing Equity, and Delivering for Tribal Communities

Advances  Efforts  to  End  Homelessness. To prevent and reduce homelessness, the Budget provides $3.7 billion, an increase of $116 million over the 2023 enacted level, for the Department of Housing and Urban  Development  (HUD) Homeless  Assistance  Grants  to  meet  renewal needs  and  expand  assistance  to  approximately 25,000 additional households, including survivors of domestic  violence  and  homeless youth.  These targeted resources would support the  Administration's  recently  released Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness . The Budget also provides $505 million for Housing  Opportunities  for  Persons  with  AIDS, serving  a  population  with  a  disproportionately high rate of homelessness and providing a critical link to services.

Prevents  Evictions. To  assist  renters  in accessing  resources  to  avoid  eviction,  make  the legal  process  during  eviction  proceedings  fairer, and mitigate future housing instability, the Budget provides $3 billion in mandatory spending for  competitive  grants  to  promote  and  solidify State and local efforts to reform eviction policies by providing access to legal counsel, emergency rental assistance, and other forms of rent relief.

Advances Equity by Preventing and Redressing  Housing  Discrimination. The Budget  provides  $90  million  to  support  State and local fair housing enforcement organizations and to further education, outreach, and training on rights and responsibilities under Federal fair housing laws.  The Budget also invests in HUD

staff  and  technical  assistance  to  affirmatively further  fair  housing  and  reduce  barriers  that restrict housing and neighborhood choice.

Expands Access to Credit to Underserved Communities. The Budget provides $341  million  for  the  Community  Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, an increase of  $17  million,  or  five  percent,  above  the  2023 enacted level, which provides historically underserved and often low-income communities access  to  credit,  capital,  and  financial  support to grow businesses, increase affordable housing, and reinforce healthy neighborhood development. To  better  address  the  shortage  of  long-term affordable  credit for development  projects  in disadvantaged  communities  and  unlock  up  to $500  million  in  financing  support,  the  Budget also includes a $10 million subsidy for the CDFI Fund's Bond Guarantee Program.

Advances Child and Family Well-Being in the Child Welfare System. The Budget proposes to  expand  and  incentivize  the  use  of  evidencebased  foster  care  prevention  services  to  keep families safely together and reduce the number of  children  entering  foster  care.    The  Budget provides  States  with  support  and  incentives  to place more foster children with relatives or other adults who have an existing emotional bond with the children and fewer children in group homes and institutions, while also providing additional funding  to  support  youth  who  age  out  of  care without  a  permanent  caregiver.    The  Budget proposes  to  nearly  double  flexible  funding  for States  through  the  Promoting  Safe  and  Stable Families program, and proposes new provisions to expand  access  to  legal  representation  for children and families in the child welfare system. In  addition,  the  Budget  proposes  to  make  the adoption tax credit refundable and to extend the credit to legal guardianships.  This would reduce the financial burden on low- and moderate-income families  wishing  to  pursue  adoption,  as  well  as for families who opt for legal guardianship.

Increases Food Security. The Budget strengthens Federal nutrition assistance programs to increase food security, including in

underserved  communities.   As  called  for  in  the Biden-Harris  Administration  National  Strategy on  Hunger,  Nutrition,  and  Health , the  Budget provides over $15 billion over 10 years to allow more States and schools to leverage participation in the Community eligibility Program to provide  healthy  and  free  school  meals  to  an additional  nine  million  children.    The  Budget includes $6.3 billion to fully fund the 6.5 million individuals expected to participate in the Special Supplemental  Nutrition  Program  for  Women, Infants, and Children.

Delivers  Significant  Funding  to  Tribal Communities. The  Administration is committed to upholding  the  Federal  Government's  trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes and Native communities.  Building on the historic advance appropriation  for  IHS  for  2024,  the  Budget requests $9.4 billion in discretionary and mandatory  resources in 2024, and proposes all  resources  as  mandatory  beginning  in  2025. Building on feedback from extensive tribal consultations,  the  Budget  provides  $4.7  billion for DOI's tribal programs, more than $690 million above  the  2023  enacted  level,  including  investments that  would  support  public  safety  and  justice, social services, and educational needs to uphold Federal trust responsibilities and advance equity for  Native  communities-and  continue  efforts to  address  the  crisis  of  Missing  and  Murdered Indigenous  Persons.    The  Budget  also  provides over $1 billion in HUD funding to support tribal efforts  to  expand  affordable  housing,  improve housing conditions and infrastructure, and increase  economic  opportunities  for  low-income families.  To ensure that tribal communities have safe, reliable water supply, the Budget builds on investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law by providing $2.8 billion in mandatory funding to the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion Fund  to  cover  the  costs  of  enacted  and  future water  rights  settlements,  as  well  as  operations and maintenance costs.

Supports Economic Opportunity in Rural Communities. The  Rural  Partners  Network (RPN)  is  an  all-of-Government  program  led  by USDA that partners with rural and tribal people

to  access  resources  and  funding  to  create  local jobs, build infrastructure, and support long-term economic stability on their own terms.   The Budget provides  $32  million  to  expand  RPN.    Through RPN, USDA is hiring new full-time Federal staff who are  from  the  region  to  work  hand-in-hand with RPN community leaders.  This investment will  also  support https:/ /Rural.gov , a  one-stopshop for all rural communities to access Federal resources.

Strengthens  American  Democracy . The Administration continues to prioritize efforts to restore and strengthen American democracy.  To provide  State  and  local  election  officials  with  a sustained  funding  stream  for  critical capital investments in America's election infrastructure and  increased  staffing  and  measures  to  ensure security  and  better  serve  voters,  the  Budget proposes  $5  billion  in  new  election  assistance

funding  to  be  allocated  over  10  years.    The Budget  includes  $1.5  billion  for  AmeriCorps,  a $166  million  increase  above  the  2023  enacted level, to:  support increasing the living allowance provided to AmeriCorps members so that national service is a more accessible pathway to success; and create opportunities for Americans to serve together  in  common  purpose.   The  Budget  also invests $73 million to support American history and  civics  education  programs,  an  increase  of $50 million over the 2023 enacted level, to help students  understand  the  U.S.  Constitution  and how  the  United  States  system  of  Government works  and  build  the  skills  required  to  fully participate in civic life. In addition, the Administration  will  work  with  the  Congress  to support  independent  local  journalism  to  better inform Americans about the matters that impact their lives and hold the powerful accountable.

## KEEPING AMERICA SAFE AND CONFRONTING GLOBAL CHALLENGES

even  as he has taken decisive action to strengthen America at home, the President has worked with allies and partners around the world to confront pressing global challenges.  Under the President's  leadership,  America  has  rallied  the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty against Russia's brutal invasion.  The Administration has reinvigorated crucial partnerships, fostered democracy  and economic prosperity, advanced global health, furthered gender equity and equality around the world, invested in the U.S. immigration system, and  strengthened  America's  military.    At  the same  time,  the  President  has  taken  action  to honor the Nation's sacred obligation to veterans by signing into law the bipartisan Sergeant First Class  Heath  Robinson  Honoring  our  Promise to  Address  Comprehensive  Toxics  Act  of  2022 (PACT Act), the most significant bill in American history  to  address  veterans'  exposure  to  burn pits  and  other  toxic  substances.    The  Budget builds  on  this  progress  through  proposals  to continue:    addressing  threats  to  global  security and strengthening the U.S. military; addressing

pressing  global  challenges;  securing  the  border and strengthening the U.S. immigration system; and honoring America's commitment to veterans, servicemembers, families, caregivers, and survivors.

Strengthens  the  Military  to  Meet  America's  Defense  Needs. The  Budget  continues to  ensure  that  U.S.  Soldiers,  Sailors,  Airmen, Marines, and Guardians remain the best trained and  equipped  fighting forces in the world.    The  Budget  places  additional  emphasis on foundational investments to sustain current  weapon  systems  and  support  increased training across the Department, while pursuing technological enhancements to extend the service life  of  materiel  vital  to  the  warfighter.    At  the same time, the Budget strengthens DOD's civilian workforce as a critical contributor to the Nation's security.  In addition, the Budget continues the recapitalization  and  optimization  of  the  four public Naval Shipyards to meet future submarine and carrier maintenance requirements. In line with the National Defense Strategy ,  the  Budget

optimizes force  structure  to  build  a  Joint  Force that  is  lethal,  resilient,  sustainable,  survivable, agile, and  responsive.    The  Budget  supports DOD's plan to upgrade capabilities by redirecting resources  to  cutting-edge  technologies  in  highpriority platforms.

Supports Ukraine, European Allies, and  Partners. The Budget provides over $6 billion to support Ukraine, the United States' strong  alliance  with  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO), and other european partner states by prioritizing funding to enhance the capabilities and readiness of United States, allied, and partner forces in the face of continued Russian aggression.

Promotes  Integrated  Deterrence  in  the Indo-Pacific  and  Globally. To  sustain  and strengthen deterrence, the Budget prioritizes The Peoples  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  as  America's pacing challenge in line with the National Defense Strategy .    DOD's  2024  Pacific  Deterrence  Initiative highlights  $9.1  billion  of  key  investments  the Department is making, focuses on strengthening deterrence  in  the  region,  and  demonstrates  the Department's long-term commitment to the IndoPacific.  DOD is building the concepts, capabilities, and posture necessary to meet these challenges, working to integrate deterrence efforts across the United States Government and with U.S. allies and partners.

Counters Malign Influence. To assert U.S. leadership in strategic competition with the PRC,  the  Budget  includes  $400  million  for  the Countering  PRC  Influence  Fund.    In  addition, the Budget requests $753 million for Ukraine to continue to counter Russian malign influence and to meet emerging needs related to security, energy, cybersecurity, disinformation, macroeconomic stabilization,  and  civil  society  resilience.    The Budget also requests continued Foreign Military Financing  loan  and  loan  guarantee  authority to ensure availability of a financing tool to help America's partners invest in U.S. equipment.

Counters Persistent Threats. While focused on  maintaining  robust  deterrence  against  the

PRC and Russia, the Budget also enables DOD to counter other persistent threats including those posed by North Korea, Iran, and violent extremist organizations.

Modernizes  the  Nuclear  Deterrent. The Budget provides $37.7 billion to DOD to maintain a  strong  nuclear  deterrent  as  a  foundational aspect of integrated deterrence, for the security of the Nation and U.S. allies.  The Budget supports the U.S. nuclear triad and the necessary ongoing nuclear modernization programs, to include the nuclear  command,  control,  and  communication networks.    In  addition,  the  Budget  provides $23.8 billion to the Department of energy's NNSA to  make  historic  investments  in  the  Nation's nuclear  security  enterprise  to  implement  the President's Nuclear Posture Review; support a  safe,  secure,  and  effective  nuclear  stockpile; reduce nuclear risks; and provide nuclear power to the U.S. Navy.

Strengthens Democracy and Defends Human Rights Globally. The Budget provides more  than  $3.4  billion  to  advance  democratic governance and foster democratic renewal.  The Budget would strengthen free and independent media, fight corruption, bolster democratic institutions,  advance  technology  for  democracy, promote gender equality and women's civic and political  participation,  and  defend  free  and  fair elections  and  political  processes.    Within  this total,  the  Budget  includes  $345  million  for  the President's  Initiative  for  Democratic  Renewal, $25  million for the President's new  African Democratic  and  Political  Transitions  initiative, as  well  as  targeted  increases  for  'bright  spot' countries experiencing democratic opportunities.

## Addressing Pressing Global Challenges

Deepens  Alliances  and  Partnerships  in the Indo-Pacific to Out-Compete  China. The  Budget  includes  more  than  $2.3  billion in discretionary  funding  for  the  Department of  State  and  the  U.S.  Agency  for  International Development  to  support  an  open,  secure,  and connected Indo-Pacific and implement the

Indo-Pacific Strategy to strengthen and modernize America's  alliances  and  partnerships  in  this vital region.  This total includes $90 million for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and $50  million  for  the  advancement  of  the  IndoPacific  economic  Framework for Prosperity.    In addition,  the  Budget  expands  funding  for  U.S. diplomatic presence throughout the region, with particular focus on the Pacific Islands.  The Budget also includes a new mandatory proposal to  Out-Compete  China  and  advance  American prosperity  through  game-changing  investments in infrastructure  and  the  Indo-Pacific.    This includes: $2 billion to bolster Indo-Pacific countries through economic competitiveness and secure and resilient supply chains; $2 billion to support 'hard'  infrastructure;  and  $2  billion  to advance the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's equity program at scale, a key financing tool to strengthen the U.S. role in the Indo-Pacific.   The Budget also proposes $7.1 billion in economic assistance and continuation of postal services over the next 20 years for the Compacts of  Free  Association  with  the  freely  associated states  of  the  Marshall  Islands,  Micronesia,  and Palau.

Reinforces  Collective  Action  to  Address Global Challenges. The Budget supports continued U.S. multilateral engagement on shared global challenges at the United Nations (UN)  and  other international organizations. The Budget fully meets U.S. annual contributions to international organizations and  pays  UN  peacekeeping  dues  on  time  and in  full.    The  Budget  also  proposes  increases for  key  opportunities  to  advance  U.S.  interests and  compete  with  adversaries,  including by: strengthening collective security through NATO, bolstering U.S. leadership at the UN by beginning to synchronize $40 million in annual contributions; providing $150 million to support a  U.S.  return  to  the  UN  educational,  Scientific and  Cultural Organization; and  contributing $57 million to support the UN Population Fund. The Budget also requests nearly $2.3 billion for contributions to multilateral development banks, maintaining the United States' role as the largest World Bank donor to support poverty reduction

and  development  in  low-  and  middle-income countries.  This includes a $1.4 billion investment in  the  International  Development  Association (IDA),  as  part  of  the  United  States'  pledge  of $3.5  billion  in  support  of  the  most  recent  IDA replenishment.    The  Budget  also  proposes  the largest request for the Peace Corps in history in order to sustain operations and partner with host countries to address global challenges and spur U.S. development leadership.

Advances the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). The Budget supports more than $50 billion through PGII  in  direct  foreign  assistance,  development and  export  finance,  and  private  sector  funding. PGII  leverages  public  and  private  finance  to advance  climate  and  energy  security, health and health  security,  digital  connectivity,  gender equity  and  equality,  and  related  transportation infrastructure-all  while  creating  opportunities for American businesses.

Bolsters American Leadership in Global  Health. To  reinforce  U.S.  leadership in  addressing global health and health security challenges,  the  Budget  includes  $10.9  billion, a $370 million increase above the 2023 enacted level.  This includes over $1.2 billion to prepare for,  prevent,  detect,  and  respond  to  infectious disease outbreaks-including by expanding U.S. bilateral partnerships with countries to improve health  security  capacity.   This  over  $1.2  billion also includes $500 million for the Pandemic Fund to catalyze and accelerate improvements to global health security and pandemic preparedness. The Budget also invests dedicated funds for the Administration's Global Health Worker Initiative to  enhance  global  efforts  to  better  train,  equip, and protect the health workforce-which would strengthen  countries'  abilities  to  provide  core health  services  and  respond  to  crises. The Budget also increases investments in highimpact and lifesaving voluntary family planning and  reproductive  health  programs  to  address significant unmet global needs for these services. The Budget sustains U.S. leadership in the Global Fund's historic seventh replenishment, providing $2  billion  for  the  second  year  of  a  $6  billion

three-year  pledge  to  save  lives  and  accelerate the  fight  against  HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis,  and malaria.

Enhances Biodefense and Pandemic Preparedness. The  Budget  provides  robust funding to support the Administration's National Biodefense  Strategy  and  Implementation  Plan and provide resources for the recommendations from DOD's Biodefense Posture Review.

Advances  Gender  Equity  and  Equality Around the World. The Administration remains steadfast in its commitment to invest in opportunities  for  women  and  girls  and  support the needs of marginalized communities, including the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and  Intersex  community.    Reflective  of that commitment,  the  Budget  requests  more  than $3 billion to advance gender equity and equality across a broad range of sectors.

Bolsters Hemispheric Economic Investment and Migration Management Efforts. In support of the Los Angeles Declaration  on  Migration  and  Protection,  the Budget  invests  $430  million  for  hemispheric migration  management.   This  assistance  would bolster stability for affected communities, enhance  legal  pathways  and  protection,  and strengthen humane border management throughout  the  region.    The  Budget  proposes a  new  regional  economic  opportunity  fund,  the Americas Partnership Opportunity Fund, to address migration management challenges faced by high and upper-middle income countries in  the  region.    The  Budget  also  requests  up to $40 million for the Global Concessional Financing  Facility  to  support  programs  aimed at improving the lives of migrants and refugees in the Western Hemisphere and $75 million for the  Inter-American  Development  Bank's  IDB Invest  to  increase  private  sector  investment  in the Americas.

Builds Security and Prosperity in Central America  and  Haiti. The  Budget  requests more than $1 billion to advance the President's commitment  to work with the Congress to

provide $4 billion over four years to address the root  causes  of  migration  and  improve  the  lives of people in Central America.  Assistance would bolster  localization  efforts,  enhance  the  rule  of law, and support economic growth for all segments of society.  Further, in response to deteriorating conditions and widespread violence in Haiti, the Budget invests $291 million to strengthen Haiti's recovery  from  political,  health,  and  economic shocks,  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the Haitian  National  Police,  combating  corruption, strengthening the capacity of civil society, responding  to  health  emergencies  and  health needs, and supporting services for marginalized populations.

Sustains U.S. Leadership on Refugee and Humanitarian Issues, including Addressing Food Insecurity. The Budget requests more than $10.5 billion to respond to the persisting needs of the world's most vulnerable, including those needs arising from conflict and natural disasters.  The Budget  supports  the  United  States'  revitalized refugee admissions program, including the resettlement of up to 125,000 refugees and related efforts, such as Uniting for Ukraine.  In addition, the  Budget  supports  the  President's  pledge  to alleviate global food insecurity by providing nearly  $1.2  billion  in  bilateral  agriculture  and food security programming.

Deepens Alliances through Space Exploration. The  Budget  provides  increased funding for two Mars missions that are partnerships  with  the  european  Space  Agency, including  one  in  which  the  United  States  is replacing  Russia  as  a  partner.    The  Budget would also include initial funding for a space tug that  would  reduce  reliance  on  Russia  and  help prepare  for  a  new  era  of  U.S.-built  commercial space stations.

Protects Afghan Allies. The Budget supports enduring Welcome (eW), the whole-ofGovernment  effort  to  expeditiously  process  the applications of America's Afghan allies, such as Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) candidates, and  family  reunification cases, and  welcome them to the United States-while simultaneously

safeguarding national security.  The Budget fully supports  implementation  of  eW  by  leveraging Department of State balances estimated to enable more than $2 billion in support in 2024, and by proposing a substantial increase to the number of SIVs available for Afghan allies.

## Strengthening Border Security and Improving the Immigration System

Enhances Border Security and Immigration  Enforcement. Strengthening border security and providing safe, lawful pathways  for  migration  remain  top  priorities for  the  Administration.    The  Budget  includes nearly $25 billion for  U.S.  Customs  and  Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs enforcement (ICe), an increase of almost $800  million  over  the  2023  enacted  level  when controlling for border management  amounts. The  Budget  includes  funds  for  CBP  to  hire  an additional 350 Border Patrol Agents, $535 million for  border  security  technology  at  and  between ports  of  entry,  $40  million  to  combat  fentanyl trafficking  and  disrupt  transnational  criminal organizations,  and  funds  to  hire  an  additional 460 processing assistants at CBP and ICe.

Supports  a  Fair,  Orderly,  and  Humane Immigration  System. The  Administration is committed to improving the Nation's immigration system and safeguarding its integrity  and  promise  by  efficiently  and  fairly adjudicating  requests  for  immigration  benefits. The Budget includes $865 million for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to process  an  increasing  asylum  caseload,  reduce the historically high immigration benefit request backlog, support the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, and improve refugee processing to advance the Administration's goal of admitting 125,000 refugees.

Addresses the Situation at the Southwest Border. Given elevated Southwest Border encounter  levels  experienced  in  a  number  of years  since  2019,  the  Budget  proposes  a  new $4.7  billion  contingency  fund  to  aid  the  DHS  and  its

components when responding to migration surges along the Southwest Border.  each fiscal year, the fund would receive appropriations incrementally, and above the base appropriation, as Southwest Border  encounters  reach  pre-identified  levels. DHS  would  be  limited  to  obligating  funds  for surge-related functions and would transfer funds to  CBP,  ICe,  and  FeMA  accounts  with  valid surge-related obligations.

Improves Immigration Courts. The Budget invests  more  than  $1.5  billion,  an  increase  of $595  million  above  the  2023  enacted  level,  in the  executive  Office  for  Immigration  Review both  to  manage  and  mitigate  the  backlog  of over  1.8  million  cases  currently  pending  in  the immigration courts that this administration largely  inherited  from  its  predecessor.    This funding  supports  150  new  immigration  judge teams,  which  includes  the  support  personnel required  to  help  optimize  the  operation  of  the immigration court system.  The Budget would also invest new resources in legal access programming, including $150 million in discretionary resources to provide access to representation for adults and families in immigration proceedings.  Providing resources to support legal representation in the immigration system would help make the system fairer  and  more  equitable,  while  allowing  for greater efficiencies in case processing.

Supports America's Promise to Refugees. The  Budget  provides  $7.3  billion  to  the  Office of  Refugee  Resettlement  (ORR)  to  help  rebuild the Nation's refugee resettlement infrastructure and  support  the  resettling  of  up  to  125,000 refugees in 2024.  The Budget also helps ensure that unaccompanied immigrant children receive appropriate  support  and  services  while  they are in ORR's care and are unified with relatives and sponsors  as  safely  and  quickly  as  possible. The funding would allow ORR to reinforce and expand on the programmatic improvements the Administration  has  made,  including  expanding access to  counsel  to  help  children  navigate  complex immigration  court  proceedings  and  enhancing case management and post-release services.  In addition, the Budget  includes  an  emergency contingency fund that would provide additional

resources,  beyond  the  $7.3  billion,  when  there are  unanticipated  increases  in  the  number  of unaccompanied children or  other  humanitarian entrants, building on the contingency fund enacted for 2023.

## Honoring the Nation's Commitments to America's Veterans, Servicemembers, and Their Families, Caregivers, and Survivors

Expands Healthcare, Benefits, and Services for Environmental Exposures. The  PACT  Act  represents  the  most  significant expansion of Veterans healthcare and disability compensation  benefits  for  veterans  exposed  to burn pits and other environmental exposures in more than 30 years.  As part of the PACT Act, the  Congress  authorized  the  Cost  of  War  Toxic exposures  Fund  (TeF)  to  fund  increased  costs above  2021  funding  levels  for  healthcare  and benefits delivery for veterans exposed to a number of  environmental  hazards-and  ensure  there  is sufficient  funding  available  to  cover  these  costs without shortchanging other elements of veteran medical  care  and  benefit  delivery.    The  Budget provides $20.3 billion for the TeF in 2024, which is $15.3 billion above the 2023 enacted level.

Prioritizes Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical  Care. The Budget provides a total  of  $121  billion  in  discretionary medical care funding in 2024, $2.3 billion above the 2023 enacted level, together with $17.1 billion in the TeF.  In addition to fully funding inpatient, outpatient,  mental  health,  and  long-term  care services, the  Budget  supports  programs  that enhance VA healthcare quality and delivery.  The Budget reiterates that medical care for veterans should be considered separately from other appropriations categories in order to ensure that the needs of veterans are never traded off against other national priorities.

Prioritizes Veterans' Mental Health Services and Suicide Prevention. The Budget invests $139 million within VA research programs, together with $16.6 billion within the

VA Medical Care program, to increase access to quality mental healthcare and lower the cost of mental health services for veterans, with the goal of helping veterans take charge of their treatment and live full, meaningful lives.  This effort includes support for the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies on risk and prevention factors.  In addition, the Budget provides $559 million to further advance the Administration's veteran suicide prevention initiatives, including continued expansion of the Veterans Crisis Line's 988 and additional support for VA's National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide.

## Invests in Caregivers Support Programs.

Recognizing  the  critical  role  family  caregivers play  in  supporting  the  health  and  wellness  of veterans,  the  Budget  provides  robust  funding for  the  Program of General Caregivers Support Services.    The  Budget  also  specifically  provides $2.4  billion  for  the  Program  of  Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, which includes stipend  payments  and  support  services  to  help empower family caregivers of eligible veterans.

Honors the Memory  of All Veterans. The  Budget  includes  $480  million  to  ensure veterans and their families have access to exceptional memorial  benefits. These  funds maintain  national  shrine  standards  at  the  158 VA-managed cemeteries and provide  the  initial operational  investment  required  to  continue  or begin activation to open three new cemeteries.

Invests in Critical Veteran Medical Facilities. The  Budget  includes  $1.6  billion in discretionary funding  and  $1.9  billion in mandatory funding for  construction  and  expansion of critical infrastructure and facilities, in addition to a $5 billion investment in discretionary medical care  for  non-recurring  maintenance  to  improve medical facility infrastructure.  The Budget also provides $164 million for grants for construction of State extended care facilities to deliver highquality healthcare, benefits, and  services  for veterans.

Fulfills America's Commitment to Military Families. Military families are key to the readiness and well-being of the All-Volunteer Force, and  therefore are critical to national security. The Budget continues to support military families by prioritizing programs, including the Secretary of Defense's Taking Care of  People  initiatives,  that  directly  support military spouses, children, caregivers, survivors, and other dependents, such as expanding access to child care and Pre-K programs.

in  the  Armed  Forces  is  a  matter  of  national security and  military readiness. Fulfilling the  President's  promise  to  transform  how  the military  addresses  sexual  assault,  the  Budget fully funds DOD's implementation of the recommendations  of  the  Independent  Review Commission  on  Sexual  Assault  in  the  Military, and advances implementation of military justice reform,  including  the  selection  and  training  of specialized,  independent  trial  counsel  who  will assume jurisdiction over sexual assault, domestic violence, and related crimes.

Strengthens  Programs  to  Prevent  and Respond to Sexual Assault. Sexual  violence

## REDUCING THE DEFICIT BY ENSURING THE WEALTHY AND BIG CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE

The President's Budget builds on the economic and fiscal progress the Nation has made over the past two years:  fueling economic growth; creating jobs;  lowering  costs  for  working  families;  and laying a strong foundation for future prosperityall  while  reducing  deficits  and  addressing  longterm fiscal risks.

The Budget reflects the President's long-held belief that the best way to responsibly reduce the deficit is to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out and invest in the foundations of the Nation's economic strength.  That is why the Budget invests in smart, fully-offset investments that expand the productive capacity of the economy,  give  working  families  more  breathing room,  and  promote  broadly  shared  prosperity. Over  the  past  two  years,  that  approach  has worked,  with  the  deficit  falling  by  a  historic amount.

The President's Budget expands on this progress-proposing investments that are more than fully paid for and reducing deficits by almost $3  trillion  over  the  next  decade  by  asking  the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to finally pay their fair share.  Under the President's policies,  annual  deficits  would  fall  from  current levels and stabilize throughout the next 10 years,

while the economic burden of debt would remain in line with historical levels.

## Making the Tax System More Fair

The President believes that America needs to reward  work,  not  wealth.    Since  taking  office, the  President  has  taken  numerous  actions  and signed significant legislation to make the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share while providing  tax  cuts  for working  families  and reducing  the  deficit.    Under  his  plan,  no  one making under $400,000 per year will pay more in new taxes.

Building  on  the  progress  the  President  has already  made  to  promote  a  fairer  tax  code,  the Budget  proposes  additional  tax  reforms  that would ensure the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share.

## Proposes a Minimum Tax on Billionaires.

The tax code currently  offers  special  treatment for the  types  of  income  that  wealthy  people enjoy.    Whereas  the  wages  and  salaries  that everyday Americans earn are taxed as ordinary income,  billionaires  make  their  money  in  ways that  are  taxed  at  lower  rates,  and  sometimes

not taxed at all. This special treatment, combined  with  sophisticated  tax  planning  and giant  loopholes,  allows  many  of  the  wealthiest Americans  to  pay  lower  rates on their full income than many middle-class households pay.  To finally address this glaring problem, the Budget  includes  a  25  percent  minimum  tax  on the wealthiest 0.01 percent, those with wealth of more than $100 million.

Ensures Corporations Pay Their Fair Share. The  Budget  includes  an  increase  to the rate that corporations pay in taxes on their profits.  Corporations received an enormous tax break in 2017, cutting effective U.S. tax rates for U.S. corporations to a low of less than 10 percent. While their profits have soared, their investment in the economy did not.  Their shareholders and top  executives  reaped  the  benefits,  without  the promised trickle down to workers, consumers, or communities.  The Budget would set the corporate tax  rate  at  28  percent,  still  well  below  the  35 percent rate that prevailed prior to the 2017 tax law.    This  tax  rate  change  is  complemented  by other  proposals  to  incentivize  job  creation  and investment in the United States and ensure large corporations pay their fair share.

Stops the Race to the Bottom in International Corporate Tax and Ends Tax  Breaks  for  Offshoring. For  decades, countries have competed for multinational business  by  slashing  tax  rates,  at  the  expense of having  adequate  revenues  to  finance  core services.  Thanks in part to the Administration's leadership, more than 130 nations signed on to a  global  tax  framework  to  finally  address  this race to the bottom.  Building on that framework, the Budget proposes to reform the international tax  system  to  reduce  the  incentives  to  book profits  in  low-tax  jurisdictions,  stop  corporate inversions to tax havens, and raise the tax rate on  U.S.  multinationals'  foreign  earnings  from 10.5 percent to 21 percent.  These reforms would ensure that profitable multinational corporations pay their fair share.

Quadruples the Stock Buybacks Tax. Last year, the President signed into law a surcharge

on corporate stock buybacks, which reduces the differential tax treatment between buybacks and dividends  and  encourages  businesses  to  invest in their  growth  and  productivity  as  opposed to funneling tax-preferred profits to foreign shareholders.  The Budget proposes quadrupling the stock buybacks tax from one percent to four percent to address the continued tax advantage for buybacks and encourage corporations to invest in productivity and the broader economy.

Repeals  President Trump's Tax  Cuts  for the Wealthy and Reforms Capital Gains Tax to Ensure the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share. The 2017 tax law lowered rates for the wealthiest Americans,  delivering  massive  tax  cuts  to  the top one percent.  The Budget repeals those cuts, restoring  the  top  tax  rate  of  39.6  percent  for single filers making more than $400,000 a year and married couples making more than $450,000 per year.  The Budget also proposes taxing capital gains at the same rate as wage income for those with more than $1 million in income and finally closes  the  carried  interest  loophole  that  allows some wealthy investment fund managers to pay tax at lower rates than their secretaries.

Closes Medicare Tax Loopholes and Makes the Medicare Trust Fund Solvent for Another Quarter Century. Current  law  lets certain wealthy business owners avoid Medicare taxes on some of the profits they get from passthrough  businesses. The  Budget  closes  the loophole that allows certain business owners to avoid paying Medicare taxes on  these profits, and dedicates revenue raised by the Net Investment Income  Tax  (NIIT)  to  the  Medicare  HI  Trust Fund,  as  originally  intended.    In  addition,  the Budget raises  the  Medicare  tax  rate  on  earned and unearned income and the NIIT rate from 3.8 percent to 5 percent for the wealthiest Americans. As discussed above, these changes, together with savings from the Budget's prescription drug reforms, would extend the solvency of the Medicare HI Trust Fund by at least 25 years.

Closes  Tax  Loopholes. The  Budget  also saves  billions  of  dollars  by  closing  other  tax loopholes  that  overwhelmingly  benefit  the  rich

and  the  largest,  most  profitable  corporations. This  includes  closing  the  so-called  'like-kind exchange loophole' that lets real estate investors defer  tax  indefinitely,  reforms  to  tax  preferred retirement  incentives  to  ensure  that  the  ultrawealthy cannot use these incentives to amass tax free fortunes, and closing a loophole that benefits wealthy crypto investors.

Addresses  Expiring  Tax  Cuts  after  2025. President  Trump  and  congressional  Republicans deliberately sunset portions of the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 legislation after 2025 to conceal both the true increase in the deficit-much larger than the already-massive $2 trillion cost estimate-and the true size of their tax breaks for multi-millionaires and large corporations.  This was one of the most egregious  and  fiscally  reckless  budget  decisions in modern history.  The President, faced with this fiscally  irresponsible  legacy ,  will  work  with  the Congress to address the 2025 expirations, and focus tax policy on rewarding work not wealth, based on the following guiding principles.  The President:

- · Opposes increasing taxes on people earning less than $400,000 and supports cutting taxes for working  people and families with children to give them more breathing room;
- · Opposes cutting taxes for the wealthy-either extending tax cuts for the wealthy or bringing back tax breaks that would benefit the wealthy; and
- · Supports  additional  reforms  to  ensure that wealthy  people and  big corporations pay their fair share, so that America pays  for  the  continuation  of  tax  cuts  for people earning less than $400,000 in a fiscally responsible manner and address the problematic sunsets created by President Trump and congressional Republicans.

## Putting America on a Stronger Fiscal Path

The  Budget's  investments  and  tax  reforms will  reduce  costs  for  everyday Americans,  boost economic  growth,  create  high-quality  jobs,  and promote shared prosperity while also improving the fiscal outlook  of the United  States  and reducing fiscal risks over the long term.

The President has already presided over historic  deficit  reduction  in  the  first  two  years of  the  Administration,  while  also  signing  into law  hundreds  of  billions  in  deficit  reduction  in the  Inflation  Reduction  Act.    Recognizing  that the  United  States  faces  fiscal  challenges  over the coming decades-driven  by demographic pressures, an  inequitable  and  inefficient tax system, and rising healthcare costs-the Budget not only offsets its investments, but improves the medium-term fiscal outlook.  In total, the Budget reduces  the  deficit  over  the  next  10  years  by nearly $3 trillion.

The  policies  proposed  in  the  Budget  would reduce  the  deficit,  as  a  share  of  the  economy, from current levels.  Under the Budget policies, the  deficit  would  decline  over  the  next  several years,  stabilizing  around  five  percent  of  GDP throughout the remainder of the 10-year window. This compares to deficits increasing to six percent by 2032 in the absence of the President's policies.

Moreover,  under  the  President's  Budget,  the economic  burden  of  debt  would  remain  low  and in line with recent historical experience over the next  decade.    The  widespread,  persistent  and global phenomenon of falling interest rates even as debt levels increased over the past four decades has meant that the burden associated with debt over  the  near  and  medium-term  has  decreased substantially.  even with the recent rise in interest rates from their historic lows, rates today remain below the levels of the 1990s and 2000s.

Real interest-the Federal Government's annual  interest  payments  after  adjusting  for inflation-directly measures the cost of servicing the debt:  the real resources that must go toward

paying  off  old  debt  rather  than  investing  in the  future  or  providing  services  to  Americans now.    Real  interest  has  averaged  about  one percent  of  the  economy  since  1980,  and  rose  to as high as two percent in the 1990s.  even as the Budget's  economic  assumptions  anticipate  an increase  in  real  interest  rates  over  the  coming decade-a projection that is in line with private

forecasters-the Budget policies nevertheless keep  real  interest  payments  in  line  with  the historical average.

Overall,  the  Budget  details  an  economically and  fiscally  responsible  plan  to  strengthen  the U.S. economy, gives families more breathing room, and reduces long-term fiscal risks.

## ENSURING AN EQUITABLE, EFFECTIVE, AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT THAT DELIVERS RESULTS FOR ALL

Under the President's leadership, the United States has made historic progress in the face of significant  challenges-powering  a  strong  economic and jobs recovery, rebuilding the Nation's infrastructure, fueling a resurgence of American manufacturing, tackling the climate crisis, and investing in America's people and communities. The  President's  Management  Agenda  (PMA) defines  Government-wide  management  priorities for all Federal agencies to improve how the Government  operates  and  performs.  The  PMA sets forth an approach to ensure that the Federal Government has the capacity and capabilities to continue  executing  the  President's  agenda  and meeting the needs of all Americans.

To  help  deliver  that  future,  the  President's Budget  advances  the  goals  of  the  PMA  across three key  priority areas: strengthening  and empowering  the  Federal  workforce;  delivering excellent, equitable,  and  secure  Federal  services  and  customer  experience;  and  managing the  business  of  Government  to  deliver  for  the American people. This  work-including  the  investments the Budget puts forward in support of the PMA-is critical for bolstering the Federal Government's capacity and capabilities to deliver for the American people today and for years to come.

## Values in Action

The  Administration's  work  to  further  develop and implement the PMA, including through the Budget, is guided by values, such as equity, dignity,  accountability,  and  results.  These  values  guide  the Administration's  work  to  deliver

results for the public and strengthen the capacity  of  Federal  agencies.  The  Budget  advances these values by:

Ensuring the Future is Made in America by  America's  Workers. The  President's  economic  agenda  is  focused  on  ensuring  the  future  is  made  by  all  of  America's  workers.  The Administration  is  working  to  deliver  on  the President's  agenda  by  advancing  a  whole-ofGovernment effort to ensure Federal resources and  programs  advance  domestic  jobs  and  industries-which includes updated guidance and rulemakings as well as through continued transparency and consistency in the waiver process. The  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB) recently  implemented  an  update  to  the  Buy American  Act  domestic  content  requirement, which increased the domestic content standard from 55 percent to a historic 60 percent in the fall of 2022-on its way to 75 percent in calendar  year  2029.  The  Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law included the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) requiring that all federally financed infrastructure projects must use American iron and steel, manufactured products, and construction  material.  OMB's  Made  in  America  Office continues to work with Federal agencies to implement the new domestic content requirements for Federal grants established by BABA. The Made in  America  Office  also  proposes  to:  maximize the use of domestic goods and service in Federal procurement and Federal Financial Assistance; strengthen  the  U.S.  industrial  base  in  critical sectors; and increase the number of good-paying jobs thanks to the domestic production of steel and iron products, manufactured products, and construction materials.

Promoting  Accountability  and  Integrity. The  Administration  is  committed  to  improving program  integrity  and  ensuring  effective  stewardship  of  taxpayer  dollars,  including  through implementation of the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan  Infrastructure  Law,  the  CHIPS  and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. To deliver on those commitments, the Administration has provided Federal agencies with the tools to strengthen program integrity and deliver results. The President has made clear that results, transparency, and  accountability go hand-in-hand, which is  why  the  Budget  includes  robust  legislative and funding proposals that would ensure agencies and their Inspectors General have the resources and authorities they need to for appropriate oversight of these programs. The Budget: ensures  resources  and  additional  time  for  investigations  and  prosecution  of  those  engaged in major or systemic pandemic fraud; invests in identity theft and fraud prevention; and provides much-needed help for victims.

Managing  the  Government  to  Deliver Results  that  Improve  Lives. Grounded  in proven, evidence-based management practices of high-performing public and private sector organizations, the Federal Government's approach to delivering a more effective and efficient Government is operationalized through the Federal Performance Framework-a set of management routines that are focused on defining mission success, engaging senior leaders to review progress using data-driven reviews, and reporting results transparently  to  the  public.  Last  year,  agencies continued making measurable progress on the 90 Agency Priority Goals (APGs) that advance nearterm  performance  improvements  in  outcomes across  key  Administration  priorities,  including improving  customer  experience,  advancing  equity,  combatting  climate  change,  improving  the Nation's infrastructure, and meeting the health, welfare, and economic challenges from COVID-19. An overwhelming majority of APGs are on-track to  meet  their  performance commitments by the end of 2023, while those that are lagging are actively implementing mitigation plans and strategies to overcome barriers informed by quarterly data-driven  reviews.  OMB  also  held  strategic

review meetings with each major agency to analyze management challenges and risks based on agencies' assessments of over 400 strategic objectives,  including  the  subset  of  approximately  90 strategic objectives designated as making 'Area Demonstrating Noteworthy Progress' or a 'Focus Area  for  Improvement,'  based  on  the  analysis from  those  reviews.  To  improve  transparency and usefulness  of  reporting,  a  new  feature  was added last year to https:/ /Performance.gov -the Administration's  central  performance  reporting portal-that allows users to explore strategic objectives and priority goals not just by agency but by policy theme.

## Strengthening and Empowering the Federal Workforce

As  the  Nation's  largest  employer,  more  than four  million  Americans,  civilian  and  military, serve  the  Federal  Government,  both  at  home and  overseas,  carrying  out  programs  and  services that benefit families across the Nation and around  the  world.  Federal  employees  are  dedicated and talented professional public servants, often working demanding jobs. To continue to deliver for the American people in the 21 st  Century, the Federal Government must win the competition for highly-skilled talent. The Budget makes investments  that  would  advance  the  first  PMA priority-strengthening and empowering the Federal  workforce-by:  expanding  Federal  strategic  agency  hiring  capacity,  prioritizing  robust early-career pipelines; implementing strategic diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility plans; and reimagining Federal executive Boards to foster coordination and collaboration amongst senior executives outside of Washington, D.C., to better communicate  and  execute  the  Administration's management and workforce priorities across regions and communities.

Helping  Agencies  Attract,  Retain,  and Hire Top Talent. Federal agencies are focused on attracting more people to Federal service over the  long  term,  while  also  addressing  immediate agency hiring needs to rebuild capacity. The Federal Government  continues  to  implement

strategic hiring practices based on skills rather than educational qualifications alone. The Budget supports the expansion of the Office of Personnel Management's  (OPM)  Hiring  experience  Office to continue making progress on streamlining hiring, including through pooled hiring actions, and improving  the  applicant  hiring  experience.  The Budget  also  supports  a  renewed  focus  on  early career pipelines as the Administration promotes the expansion of, and equitable access to Federal paid  internships.  The  Budget  also  provides  resources to support new agency requirements for personnel vetting improvements, and its Trusted Workforce 2.0 Implementation Strategy , which is designed to ensure all Americans can trust the Federal workforce to protect people, property, information, and mission. The Budget provides an average pay increase of 5.2 percent for civilian and military personnel-and answers the President's call for agencies to lead by example in supporting Federal worker organizing and collective bargaining. In addition, the Budget also maintains the Administration's unwavering support for the career  civil  service  through  its  advancement  of a legislative proposal to block Schedule F, which would  threaten  the  proper  functioning  of  the Federal Government by unduly subjecting career employees to politization and favoritism.

Building the Personnel System and Support  Required  to  Sustain  the  Federal Government  as  a  Model  Employer. As  the Government faces increasingly complex challenges,  the  need  for  Federal  leaders,  managers,  and front-line staff with the right skills in the right jobs has never been greater. To meet this need, the Budget  provides  $464  million,  $78  million  over the  2023  enacted  level,  for  OPM's  Salaries  and expenses account to enhance the Agency's ability to lead Federal human capital management and, in alignment with the Agency's Strategic Plan, to serve as a centralized leader in Federal human resources.  This  funding  would  support  staffing to  improve  customer  service  provided  by  OPM to  Federal  agencies,  allowing  further  collaboration in support of the Federal Government's strategic  workforce  planning  and  talent  acquisition functions.

## Delivering Excellent, Equitable, and Secure Federal Services and Customer Experience

Americans rely on Federal services to support them through disasters, advance their businesses, provide opportunities for their families, safeguard their rights, and help rebuild their communities. The Federal Government must deliver a simple, seamless, and secure customer experience, on par with,  or  more  effective  than  leading  consumer experiences. Irrespective of age, location, digital savvy, disability, education, or english proficiency,  the  American  people  deserve  a  Government that understands who they are, what they need, and how best to deliver for them. The Budget supports  increased  mechanisms  for  providing  feedback and input from the public into the work of Government, hiring for the skills and expertise required to conduct human centered design and digital service delivery, and the formation of interagency  teams  to  tackle  pain  points  from  the lens of  how people experience Government programs at critical moments in their lives.

The Budget advances these efforts-delivering excellent, equitable, and secure Federal services and customer experience-by:

- · Standing  up  or  greatly  expanding  departmental  customer  experience  offices at nine Federal agencies, including at the Departments  of  Agriculture,  Commerce, Homeland  Security,  the  Interior,  Labor, the Treasury, Veterans Affairs, the Small Business Administration,  and  the  Social Security Administration (SSA);
- · Hiring more than 120 new full-time equivalent individuals with relevant customer experience skills;
- · Investing in new 'Voice of Customer' programs at seven Federal agencies to collect and  report  experience  performance  data on key drivers of customer experience from a  broad  representation  of  Americanswhich  would  drive  meaningful  service improvements;

- · embedding the General Service Administration's Technology Transformation Services (TTS) with six Federal agencies  to  work  directly  on  priority  service improvement projects. The highly specialized  customer experience and digital delivery talents at TTS provide flexible surge capacity for Federal agencies in their customer  experience  transformation. TTS will  work  with  the  highest-volume  and highest-web-traffic Federal service providers  to  improve  their  website  content, ensuring that information is clear and that services such as text messaging and virtual chat agents are more widely available; and
- · Supporting  specific  service  delivery  improvements, such as: a pilot program at the Transportation Security Agency to deploy customer experience professionals at airports  to  streamline  passenger  screening, improve wayfinding and communications, and  collect  customer  feedback;  supporting  the  Department  of  State's  efforts  to build online passport renewal, among other  modernized  services;  and  supporting the  Internal  Revenue  Service's  customer experience focus on improving online account access for taxpayers.

Designing, Building, and Managing Government Service Delivery for Key Life Experiences. By better coordinating service delivery based on actual life experiences instead of bureaucratic silos, the Federal Government can better  serve  the  American  public.  The  Budget advances these efforts by providing funding for interagency teams to simplify the process of accessing Government services. Following the first year of discovery sprints designed to assess the most effective path forward, the Budget supports cross-agency, life experience pilots, including:

- · Funding  for  the  Health  Resources  and Services Administration to help Americans more easily  access  essential  services  following  the  birth  of  a  child,  including  by prioritizing innovative, family-centered,
- and  culturally  competent  approaches  to helping  families  obtain  critical  support and information;
- · Improving the efficiency, program integrity, and  accessibility of safety net benefits-especially in moments when families face a financial shock-by funding the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Administration for Children and Families to work with crossagency partners to improve data sources and verification services infrastructure;
- · Providing  resources  for  SSA  and  CMS  to jointly pilot efforts to improve the Medicare enrollment  experience  for  people  applying for Medicare benefits, including for those enrolling in Medicare before enrolling in Social Security , and for exploring options to eliminate the need to have to wait for a Medicare card in the mail to connect to coverage; and
- · Building  shared  products  and  platforms that enable simple, seamless, and secure services  across  the  Federal  Government such as  the  U.S.  Web  Design  System,  Digital Analytics  Program, Digital.gov , Search. gov , Touchpoints Feedback Analytics, and exploring  the  creation  of  Governmentwide  web  content  standards  and  search engine  optimization  practices,  including the potential of using Search.gov to better structure and connect information across agency websites.

## Managing the Business of Government

The  Federal  Government  influences  and  reshapes  markets,  supports  key  supply  chains, drives technological advances, and supports domestic  manufacturing.  This  scale  of  impact creates  an  opportunity  to  leverage  Federal  systems-including the goods and services the Government  buys  and  the  financial  assistance and resources  it  provides  and  oversees-to  create  good-paying  union  jobs,  address  persistent

wealth  and  wage  gaps,  and  tackle  other  challenges. The Administration has taken bold action to  leverage  Federal  acquisition,  financial  assistance, and financial management systems to take on some of the Nation's most pressing challenges. The  Budget  supports  this  important  work  and advances the third PMA priority-managing the business of Government-by:

Maximizing the Impact of Federal Procurement. The Administration  is  using  the Federal Government's vast purchasing power to  promote  clean  energy  solutions  and  support American jobs while advancing equity. In pursuit of the President's vision of a clean energy future, the  Administration  has  set  ambitious  goals  to reach  100  percent  carbon  pollution-free  Federal electricity by 2030, 100 percent zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035, and net-zero emissions in Federal buildings by 2045. Simultaneously, the Administration  is  working  aggressively  to  advance equity through procurement by increasing the percent of Federal contract award dollars that go to small disadvantaged businesses-with a historic goal of 15 percent by 2025-which would help break down barriers, increase access to opportunities and representation in the Federal marketplace,  and  create  a  more  resilient  supplier  base. The Administration is improving the efficiency of the Federal procurement system through measures such as skills-based hiring, work-based learning, and increased procurement data interoperability.

## Supporting Ongoing Improvements to Federal Government Capabilities and Systems in Support of the PMA

The  Budget  also  supports  ongoing  improvements  to  Federal  Government  capabilities  that support an equitable, effective, and accountable Government by:

Bolstering Federal Cybersecurity. To  protect  against  foreign  adversaries  and  safeguard Federal  systems  that  the  American  people  rely on,  the  Budget  bolsters  cybersecurity  by  ensuring  every  agency  is  increasing  the  security  of public services and is successfully implementing

executive Order 14028, 'Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity' and the OMB  Memorandum M-22-09,  Moving  the  U.S.  Government  Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles. OMB and  the  Office  of  the  National  Cyber  Director released the OMB Memorandum M-22-16, Administration Cybersecurity Priorities for the 2024 Budget, which lays out three cyber investment  areas  for  Federal  civilian  executive Branch  agencies:  Improving  the  Defense  and Resilience of  Government Networks; Deepening Cross-Sector Collaboration in Defense of Critical  Infrastructure;  and  Strengthening  the Foundations  of  our  Digitally-enabled  Future. To advance the Administration's commitment to making  cyberspace  more  resilient  and  defensible, the Budget provides an additional $145 million  for  the  Cybersecurity  and  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), for a total of $3.1 billion. This includes $98 million to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2021 and $425 million to improve CISA's internal cybersecurity and analytical capabilities.

Advancing  Federal  Agency  Capacity  for Evidence-Based Policymaking. The President has  made  clear  that  the  Administration  will make decisions guided by the best available science and data by: bolstering capacity for evidence building;  investing  in  skilled  evaluators  and  in agencies'  capacity  for  program  evaluation  activities  in  order  to  execute  priority  studies,  including  those  identified  in  the  publicly-posted Learning Agendas and Annual evaluation Plans required by the Foundations for evidence-Based Policymaking  Act  of  2018;  investing  in  skilled statisticians  and  statistical  infrastructure,  including those that bolster public trust in statistical agencies, promote a seamless data user experience, equip agency leaders in data quality and confidentiality,  and  recognize  the  importance  of Federal statistics in strengthening the evidence base.

Modernizing Federal Information Technology (IT) Policies and Technology to Deliver a Better Experience for the American People. Technology  serves  as  the  foundation  of the  Federal  Government's  ability  to  deliver  on

its mission. The Administration is leading on the technology issues of the day, taking concrete steps to protect the Nation's Federal systems from compromises, leveraging the benefits of digital identity and artificial intelligence while balancing risk, redefining security expectations for software and the cloud, and maximizing the impact of taxpayer dollars to deliver a better customer experience for the American  people.  The  Administration  is  focused on understanding where agencies are on their IT modernization  journeys  and  making  intentional investments  at  the  right  time  to  enable  secure technology and innovation to advance from year to  year. To  support  IT  modernization efforts, the Budget  also  includes  an  additional  $200  million for  the  Technology  Modernization  Fund  (TMF), an  innovative  investment  program  that  gives agencies additional ways to deliver services to the American  public  quickly,  which  manages  nearly $700 million for 38 investments, across 22 Federal agencies,  and  has  received  and  reviewed  more than 220 proposals totaling $3.5 billion in funding demand.  TMF  is  particularly  well-positioned  to make a large impact in the Federal Government's ability to deliver excellent, equitable, and secure services  and  customer  experience  by  identifying opportunities to leverage technology across agencies and investing in IT modernization, cybersecurity, and user-facing services. The TMF improves the likelihood of project success through an incremental investment approach, tying project funding to delivery of milestones and strong technical

oversight. The TMF has proven to be a catalyst to show what is possible across Government-and to scale lessons learned.

Strengthening  and  Accelerating  Federal Environmental  Reviews  and  Permitting. With the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States  is  making  a  once-in-a-generation  investment  in  America's  infrastructure  and  competitiveness that will create good-paying union jobs, grow  the  U.S.  economy,  invest  in  communities, and  combat  climate  change.  To  make  the  most of  these  historic  investments  and  ensure  the timely and sound delivery of critical infrastructure  projects,  the  Administration  released The Biden-Harris Permitting Action Plan to Rebuild America's  Infrastructure,  Accelerate  the  Clean Energy Transition, Revitalize Communities, and Create Jobs (Biden-Harris Permitting Action Plan) to  ensure  the  Federal  environmental  review and permitting process is: effective; efficient; timely and transparent; guided by the best available  science  to  promote  positive  environmental and  community  outcomes;  and  shaped  by  early and meaningful public engagement. The Budget provides agencies with resources to execute the Biden-Harris  Permitting  Action  Plan , and strengthen and accelerate Federal environmental reviews and permitting processes. These resources would help deliver infrastructure investments on time, on task, and on budget.

## DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for providing nutrition assistance to low-income Americans and a safety net for the farm sector, and for conserving and preserving the Nation's forests and private agricultural lands.  The President's 2024 Budget for USDA invests in:  creating jobs and opportunity in rural communities; lowering energy costs for Americans; strengthening food supply chains and the nutrition safety net; supporting underserved farmers and producers; restoring America's advantage in agriculture; tackling the climate crisis while mitigating its ongoing impacts; and advancing environmental justice.

The Budget requests $30.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $3.8 billion or 14-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, excluding Food for Peace Title II Grants, which are included in the State and International Programs total.  Resources provided through the 2024 Budget complement investments in conservation, forest management, and broadband deployment provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Supports a Strong Nutrition Safety Net. The Budget provides $7.1 billion for critical nutrition programs, including $6.3 billion to fully fund the 6.5 million individuals expected to participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program (SNAP) for Women, Infants, and Children, which is critical to the health of pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children.  This program helps low-income families put nutritious food on the table and addresses racial disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.  The Budget also includes $15 billion over 10 years to allow more States and schools to leverage participation in the Community eligibility Provision to provide healthy and free school meals to an additional nine million children.
- · Builds and Protects a Fair and Resilient Food Supply Chain. The Budget supports ongoing actions to develop more diverse, robust, and resilient local and regional supply chains by targeting funding to increase the production capacity among smaller producers, including continuing overtime user fee relief as established in the American Rescue Plan.  The Budget complements these targeted investments by strengthening market oversight through the Agricultural Marketing Service to support fair markets and competitive meat and poultry product prices for American families and increasing safeguards against invasive pests and diseases through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.  These programs build on the pandemic and supply chain assistance funding in the American Rescue Plan to address COVID-19 pandemic-related vulnerabilities in the food system and create new market opportunities and good-paying jobs that promote a safe and healthy work environment.  The Budget also provides an increase of $102 million above the 2023 enacted level for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) for a total of $1.3 billion.  This funding would enable

the hiring of more inspectors and public health veterinarians, which would help increase the strength and flexibility of FSIS to respond to market demands and provide safe and healthy food products.

- · Connects More Rural Americans to High-Speed, Affordable, and Reliable Internet. The President is  committed  to  ensuring  that  every American  has  access  to  broadband  internet.  Installing high-speed internet creates high-paying union jobs and strengthens rural economies, which leads to higher property values, increased job and population growth, lower unemployment rates, and new business formation.  Reliable internet is also crucial for rural Americans to access healthcare services through telehealth.  Building on the $2 billion for USDA broadband programs provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2023, the Budget provides $400 million for the ReConnect program, which provides grants and loans to deploy broadband to unserved areas, especially tribal areas.  With the funding provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, USDA has provided nearly $548 million to people living and working across 21 States and Territories, which is expected to expand access to 43,189 households.
- · Invests in the Wildland Firefighting Workforce. The Budget ensures that no Federal firefighter would make less than $15 an hour and invests in the wildland firefighting workforce at USDA and the Department of the Interior (DOI) through a new comprehensive and equitable compensation structure.  The Budget also increases the size of the workforce at USDA and DOI and supports additional mental and physical health services for that workforce.  Together, these efforts would help address long-standing recruitment and retention challenges.  These investments, totaling $316 million over the 2023 enacted level, would build on the historic reforms in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and ensure that the Forest Service receives the support it needs to continue meeting evolving mission demands, as both the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires are expected to continue to increase due to climate change.
- · Reduces Catastrophic Wildfire Risk. The Budget provides $323 million to complement $1.8 billion provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and $1.6 billion provided in the Inflation Reduction Act for 2023 to support ongoing implementation of the 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy .  These resources would increase the scale of hazardous fuel reduction and restoration treatments within high-risk 'firesheds' as part of the Administration's comprehensive, nationwide response to the threat of catastrophic wildfire to natural resources, communities, and infrastructure.
- · Increases Climate Resilience. The Budget provides $1.2 billion, $208 million above the 2023 enacted level, to increase conservation adoption and farm income across privately owned land through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  The Budget builds upon and supports the generational investments provided through the Inflation Reduction Act to increase the voluntary adoption of conservation practices that sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with agricultural production.  Within the amount provided in the Inflation Reduction Act are funds to develop a system to quantify environmental impacts at the field level.  This important effort supports a foundation for voluntary environmental services markets, complementing NRCS's work by leveraging private and other non-Federal investments and providing additional income opportunities for America's farmers.   To  implement these investments, NRCS would draw upon Federal, State, and private conservationists, hiring thousands of employees-creating good paying jobs throughout rural America.  The Budget also proposes to make USDA's cover crop pilot program permanent.

- · Lowers Energy Costs and Supports Building Clean Energy in Rural Communities. Rural communities are critical to achieving the goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. The Budget builds on the $13 billion provided in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce energy bills  for  families,  expand clean energy, transform rural power production, and create thousands of good-paying jobs for people across rural America.  The Budget provides $30 million for  grants and $1 billion for loan guarantees for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency  improvements  for  farmers  and  rural  small  businesses.   The  Budget  also  provides $6.5  billion  in  authority  for  rural  electric  loans  to  support  additional  clean  energy,  energy storage, and transmission projects that would create good-paying jobs.  In addition, the Budget includes $15 million to support the creation of the Rural Clean energy Initiative.  This funding would provide critical technical assistance to rural electric providers and help to achieve the President's clean energy goals and ensure funding reaches rural areas.
- · Restores  American  Leadership  in  Agricultural  Innovation  and  Research. The People's Republic of China has become the largest funder of agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) in the world, surpassing the United States and the european Union.  The Budget restores American innovation in agriculture by providing a total of more than $4 billion, a $299 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, for agricultural research, education, and outreach.  This includes $370 million to increase capacity among historically underserved populations.  The Budget provides $7 billion for climate related funding, a $2 billion increase over the 2023 enacted level.  This amount includes $612 million for the Department's core climate related R&amp;D activities, which includes the impacts of weather and water cycle variations on soil, air, and water resources needed for agricultural production.  In addition, the Budget invests in ensuring innovative products can come to market safely and efficiently with improved regulatory review.
- · Promotes Climate Resiliency and Reduces Housing Insecurity in Rural Communities. Affordable housing has been a long-standing problem for low-income residents  in  rural  communities,  one  that  is  exacerbated  by  low  energy  efficiency  of  the  aging housing stock which means higher costs to families.  To help address this, the Budget includes a new proposal to eliminate the existing low-income borrower penalty that requires individuals to repay subsidy costs for Single-Family Direct loans-a requirement that only exists for rural housing.  The Budget also increases funding by $331 million above the 2023 enacted level for USDA's multifamily housing programs.  This initiative would allow the Administration to reduce rent burdens for low-income borrowers while also increasing the resiliency of rural housing to the impacts of climate change through a proposal to require energy and water efficiency  improvements and green features in USDA's rural housing programs that include construction.
- · Supports the 2023 Farm Bill. The Budget provides USDA with the staffing resources necessary to implement the 2023 Farm Bill.  The Administration looks forward to working this year with the Congress, partners, stakeholders, and the public to identify shared priorities for the 2023 Farm Bill that positions USDA to seamlessly continue implementation and build on the historic legislative achievements of the first two years of the Administration.  The 2023 Farm Bill is a crucial opportunity for American agriculture and rural America to transform the food and agricultural system from one that benefits a few to one that benefits many, while strengthening USDA's nutrition programs, which are among the most far-reaching tools available to improve the health and well-being of Americans.  To advance the vision of agriculture and rural economies building opportunity from the bottom up and middle out, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to create opportunity and new revenue streams for American farmers, ranchers, and producers of all sizes through climate smart agriculture

and forestry, biobased products, renewable energy, local and regional food systems, and other value-added opportunities, while reducing the paperwork burden for Federal programs and achieving best in Government practices.

The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to:  support new and beginning farmers; shore up the Federal Government's commitment to agricultural research; address climate change through voluntary incentives to reduce climate risk and improvements to crop insurance; maintain a commitment to conservation programs and investments in clean energy; continue efforts on food loss and waste; and implement climate-smart agriculture and forestry actions to open new market opportunities and provide a competitive advantage for American producers-including small and historically underserved producers and early adopters. In addition, the Administration seeks to protect rural communities by exploring solutions related to  chemical  contaminations  of  crops,  livestock,  and  water,  along  with  strengthening  biodefense and animal health and disease protection, in line with the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Security .  The 2023 Farm Bill is also a critical opportunity to ensure that the wealth created in rural America stays there and to empower rural communities with the tools necessary to advance their locally-led vision.

The 2023 Farm Bill is also an opportunity to make progress toward the goal of ensuring that all  Americans  have  access  to  healthy,  affordable  food,  as  emphasized  in  the Biden-Harris Administration's National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. This is an important moment to reconsider strengthening cross enrollment capabilities across Federal assistance programs and eliminating barriers to food assistance for vulnerable groups.  These barriers make it difficult for underserved groups to succeed, including low-income college students, individuals reentering society and seeking a second chance, youth who have aged out of foster care,  kinship  families,  low-income  individuals  in  the  U.S. Territories,  and  SNAP  recipients facing time limits.  Rather than reducing obstacles to employment, research demonstrates that time limits on SNAP eligibility amplify existing inequities in food and economic security. Beyond removing barriers to food access, there is also the opportunity to make healthier choices easier by expanding food purchasing options, fruit and vegetable incentives, and local food procurement through Federal nutrition programs, including by building upon efforts already plotted by USDA.  The Farm Bill reauthorization process is also an opportunity to strengthen program integrity to address new risks and vulnerabilities while ensuring that USDA can continue to support the needs of all eligible households.

## DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

The Department of Education (ED) is responsible for assisting States, school districts, and institutions of higher education in providing high-quality education to all students and addressing the inequitable barriers underserved students face in education.  The President's 2024 Budget for ED:  makes critical investments to spur the Nation's future prosperity; addresses learning and funding gaps between more and less advantaged students; bolsters mental health supports for students; expands access to high-quality preschool; meets the needs of students with disabilities; increases affordability and quality in higher education; and invests in programs to improve connections between the K-12 system, higher education, and the workforce.

The Budget requests $90 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $10.8 billion or 13.6-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

## Pre-K to -12th Grade Education

- · Invests in High-Poverty Schools. To help ensure that every student receives a high-quality education, the Budget provides $20.5 billion for Title I, a $2.2 billion increase above the 2023 enacted level.  This funding would continue historic progress over the past two years, as the Congress has provided a total increase of $1.9 billion for Title I since 2021.  Title I delivers critical funding to 90 percent of school districts across the Nation, helping them to provide students in low-income communities the academic opportunities and support they need  to  succeed.    This  investment  addresses  chronic  funding  gaps  between  high-poverty schools-which disproportionately serve students of color-and their wealthier counterparts and would help schools sustain critical investments in accelerated learning and other areas that were made with American Rescue Plan funds.
- · Expands Access to High-Quality Preschool. The Budget includes a major new mandatory funding proposal for a Federal-State partnership to provide free, high-quality preschool offered in the setting of a parent's choice-from public schools to child care providers to Head Start.  The proposal gives States the flexibility to expand preschool to three-year-old children once they make high-quality preschool fully available to four-year-old children.  Over the next 10 years, this proposal would dramatically expand access to effective early childhood education, ensuring students enter kindergarten ready to succeed.  This proposal would be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services in collaboration with eD. The Budget also includes $500 million for demonstration grants to create or expand free, high-quality preschool in school or community-based settings for children eligible to attend Title I schools.  The demonstration grants, which would require close collaboration among school districts, Head Start, and other community-based providers, would serve as models

that could be adopted across the Nation.  This program would expand its reach by encouraging districts to leverage Title I funds, along with other Federal, State, and local funds.

- · Bolsters Mental Health Supports for All Students. Just as physical health and nutrition is critical to learning, so too is mental health.  The lingering impacts of COVID-19 pandemic disruptions have taken a heavy toll on the physical and mental health of many students, teachers, and school staff.  Research shows that students who receive social, emotional, and mental and behavioral supports perform better academically.  The Budget provides $578 million to increase the number of school-based counselors, psychologists, social workers, and other health professionals in K-12 schools and to support colleges and universities develop campus-wide strategies to address student mental health needs including hiring additional providers on their campuses.  This funding is in addition to the $1 billion the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provided to address mental health staffing shortages in schools.
- · Increases Support for Children with Disabilities. every child with a disability should have access to the high-quality early intervention, special education services, and personnel needed to thrive in school and graduate ready for college or a career.  The Budget invests $16.8 billion in Individuals with Disabilities education Act (IDeA) grants to support special education and related services for more than 7 million students with disabilities in grades Pre-K through 12, an increase of $2.1 billion above the 2023 enacted level.  The Budget also invests $932 million in IDeA Part C grants, an increase of $392 million above the 2023 enacted level, which support early intervention services for infants and families with disabilities that are critical to supporting children's developmental and academic outcomes.  The increased funding would support States in implementing important reforms to expand enrollment of underserved children, including children of color, children from low-income families, and children living in rural areas.  The increase includes $200 million to expand and streamline enrollment of children at risk of developing disabilities, such as children born with very low-birth weight or who have been exposed to environmental toxins, which would help mitigate the need for more extensive services later in childhood and further expand access to the program for underserved children.  To address persistent special educator shortages States are facing, the Budget also invests $304 million to train and retain special education teachers, related service providers, and early intervention personnel.  In addition, the Budget invests $20 million to ensure military-connected children with disabilities and other highly mobile children with disabilities maintain services when they change school districts.
- · Supports Full-Service Community Schools. Community schools play a critical role in providing comprehensive wrap-around services to students and their families, including afterschool  programs, adult education opportunities, and health and nutrition services.  The Budget provides $368 million for this program, an increase of $218 million above the 2023 enacted level.  The increase would also help school districts implement integrated student supports to meet student and family social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs through partnerships with community-based organizations and other entities.
- · Addresses Critical Educator Shortages. While the education sector has faced shortages in critical staffing areas for decades, those shortages have grown worse since the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the importance of building strong pipelines into the profession and retaining  educators.    The  Budget  includes  $93  million  for  Supporting  effective  education Development, an increase of $13 million above the 2023 enacted level, $132 million for the Teacher Quality Partnership program, an increase of $62 million above the 2023 enacted level, and $30 million for the Hawkins Centers of excellence program, an increase of $15 million above the 2023 enacted level, to expand the number of prospective teachers and improve the

diversity of the teacher pipeline.  The Budget also includes critical investments in recruitment and retention of teachers and school leaders, and provides $200 million for the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Fund, $27 million above the 2023 enacted level, and $40 million for School Leader Recruitment and Support to support such activities.

- · Supports Multilingual Learners. Students learning english as a second language were disproportionately impacted by disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, and schools face a shortage of bilingual teachers.  The Budget provides $1.2 billion for the english Language Acquisition program, an increase of $305 million above the 2023 enacted level, to help students learning english attain english proficiency and achieve academic success.  The Budget proposes a total of $100 million for staffing needs, with $90 million in dedicated funding to help schools hire more bilingual teachers and allow States and districts to provide professional development on multilingual education for existing teachers and staff, and $10 million for postsecondary fellowships to bolster the multilingual educator pipeline.  In addition, the Budget includes $25 million to support a new World Languages program to assist districts in scaling up high-quality second language learning and instruction.
- · Fosters Diverse Schools. Racial isolation and concentrated poverty in schools can undermine their ability to provide an equal opportunity for all students to learn and succeed.  The Budget includes $100 million for a grant program to support voluntary efforts by communities interested  in  developing  and  implementing  strategies  to  promote  racial  and  socioeconomic diversity in their schools.

## Education Beyond High School

- · Reimagines the High School to Higher Education Transition. Reimagining traditional educational pathways to higher education is critical to improving outcomes for all students. The Budget provides a $200 million investment, focused on the Career-Connected High Schools initiative, to increase the integration and alignment of the last two years of high school and the first two years of higher education by expanding access to dual enrollment, work-based learning, college and career advising, and the opportunity to earn industry-recognized credentials while in high school.
- · Improves College Affordability and Provides Free Community College. To help lowand  middle-income  students  overcome  financial  barriers  to  postsecondary  education,  the Budget proposes to increase the discretionary maximum Pell Grant by $500, expanding access to the grant to reach over 6.8 million students.  This request builds on successful bipartisan efforts to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $900 over the past two years, and provides a path to double the maximum award by 2029.  The Budget also expands free community college across the Nation through a new Federal-State partnership.  To lay the groundwork for this program, the Budget includes $500 million in a new discretionary grant program to provide two-years of free community college for students enrolled in high-quality programs that lead to a four-year degree or a good-paying job.  In addition, the Budget provides two years of subsidized tuition for students from families earning less than $125,000 enrolled in a four-year Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Tribally Controlled College and University (TCCU), or Minority-Serving Institution (MSI).
- · Supports Students through Completion. The Budget supports strategies to improve the retention, transfer, and completion rates of students by investing in the Federal  TRIO Programs, Gaining early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, and Postsecondary Student Success Grants Program.  The Budget also promotes student success through the

creation of new funding for postsecondary mental health supports, and investments to build holistic systems of student supports and academic success by providing critical resources to support students' basic needs, including increased funding to help students access non-student aid public benefits and to provide affordable child care for low-income student parents.

- · Expands institutional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and Community Colleges. The Budget increases institutional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and under-resourced institutions,  including  community  colleges,  by  providing  an  increase  of  $429  million  above the 2023 enacted level.  This significant funding includes $350 million for four-year HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs to expand research and development infrastructure at these institutions.
- · Invests in Services for Student Borrowers. The Budget provides $2.7 billion for the Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), a $620 million increase above the 2023 enacted level.  This additional funding is needed to provide better support to student loan borrowers, especially as they return to repayment.  This increase would allow FSA to implement critical improvements to  student  loan  servicing,  continue  to  modernize  its  digital  infrastructure,  and  ensure  the successful administration of its financial aid programs through a simplified and streamlined process for students and borrowers.

## Office for Civil Rights

- · Strengthens  Civil  Rights  Enforcement. The  Budget  provides  $178  million  to  the Department of education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a 27-percent increase above the 2023 enacted level.  This robust funding would ensure that OCR has sufficient capacity to protect equal access to education through the enforcement of civil rights laws.

The Budget requests $52 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $6.2 billion or 13.6-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, which includes the $2.1 billion rescission of Strategic Petroleum Reserve balances enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Advances Critical Climate Goals and Cuts Energy Prices for American Families. The Budget includes $11.9 billion in DOe climate and clean energy research, development, demonstration, and deployment, 20 percent over the 2023 enacted level-funding that is critical for achieving the goal of a 50- to 52-percent reduction from 2005 levels in economywide net GHG pollution in 2030 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050, while also cutting energy bills for American families.
- · Makes Historic Investments in Cutting-Edge Research at National Laboratories and Universities through the CHIPS and Science Act and Beyond and Invests in Climate Innovation. To boost American innovation and reestablish American leadership in research and scientific discovery, the Budget provides a historic investment of $8.8 billion for the Office of Science, $680 million or 9 percent above the 2023 enacted level, advancing toward the CHIPS and Science Act full authorization level.  These investments would:  support cutting-edge research at the national laboratories and universities and building and operating world-class scientific user facilities; advance the Nation's understanding of climate change; identify  and  accelerate  novel  technologies  for  clean  energy  solutions,  including  a historic $1 billion investment in the acceleration of efforts to achieve fusion, a promising clean energy power source; provide new computing insight through quantum information science and artificial intelligence that addresses scientific challenges; expanding innovation in the microelectronics ecosystem; leverage data, analytics, and computational infrastructure to strengthen and support U.S. biodefense and pandemic preparedness strategies and plans; and position the United States to meet the demand for isotopes. The Budget invests $35 million in the Office of energy efficiency and Renewable energy for a new laboratory at a Historically Black College and University, Tribal College and University, or Minority Serving Institution.  The Budget also invests in programs to ensure DOe funded research

can be commercialized by private industry.  In total, the Budget supports U.S. preeminence in developing innovative technologies that accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy, including $9.4 billion, an increase of more than 16 percent over the 2023 enacted level, in DOe clean energy research, development, and demonstration, a portion of which is captured in the CHIPS and Science Act funding.  This also includes over $4 billion to support the Net-Zero Game Changers Initiative's five initial focus areas:  low-GHG building heating and cooling; net-zero aviation; net-zero power grid and electrification; industrial products and fuels for a net-zero, circular economy; and fusion energy.

- · Creates  Jobs  Building  Clean  Energy  Infrastructure  and  Cuts  Energy  Costs  for American Families. The Budget invests nearly $2 billion to support clean energy workforce and infrastructure projects across the Nation, including:  $425 million to weatherize and retrofit homes of low-income Americans'; $83 million to electrify tribal homes and transition tribal colleges and universities to renewable energy; and $107 million for the Grid Deployment Office to support utilities and State and local governments in building a grid that is more secure, reliable, and resilient and that integrates increasing levels of renewable energy.  These investments, which complement and bolster the historic funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, would create good-paying jobs while driving progress toward the Administration's climate goals, including carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.
- · Reduces Industrial Emissions. Meeting the challenge of climate change will require dramatic technological advances across energy use sectors.  The industrial sector in particular represents a major opportunity for significant GHG reductions while modernizing the U.S. industrial base for a more competitive future.  Across the $1.2 billion in DOe discretionary funding  for  industrial  decarbonization  activities  described  above,  the  Budget  reflects  the importance  of  strategically  supporting  U.S.  industrial  decarbonization  through  innovation, targeted investment, and technical assistance.  The Budget encourages adoption of industrial decarbonization solutions including through the Office of Manufacturing and energy Supply Chains (MeSC) and expanded research and development efforts in the Industrial efficiency and Decarbonization Office.  The Budget includes $160 million for the Office of Clean energy Demonstrations to support at least two large-scale industrial decarbonization projects directly benefitting disadvantaged communities.
- · Strengthens Domestic and International Clean Energy Supply Chains. To build on the resurgence of American manufacturing, the Budget complements funding provided in the Inflation Reduction Act by providing robust support for Loan Program Office administrative expenses to originate and oversee the ambitious growth in the financing of clean energy and advanced technology vehicle manufacturing projects envisioned in the Inflation Reduction Act. The Budget proposes a $75 million investment to launch a Global Clean energy Manufacturing effort within the MeSC that would build resilient supply chains for climate and clean energy equipment through engagement with allies, enabling an effective global response to the climate crisis while creating economic opportunities for the United States to increase the global clean technology market.  In addition, the Administration supports the use of the Defense Production Act at DOe to support rebuilding domestic uranium production and enrichment capacity to establish a secure supply for the Nation's current and future nuclear fleet and also to reduce reliance on foreign supplies of uranium, as well as other clean energy technologies to ensure robust supply chains for electrical transformers and other critical grid components. The Budget also includes $75 million in MeSC for DOe to carry out the President's recent determinations under the Defense Production Act.

- · Supports Energy Communities. The  Budget  provides  $905  million  for  DOe's  Office  of Fossil energy and Carbon Management to advance technologies that can provide economic revitalization opportunities in energy communities.  The Budget also includes dedicated funding for the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and economic Revitalization to coordinate interagency efforts and stakeholder engagement across Federal agencies.  This interagency effort would expand the delivery of Federal resources and advance job-creating investments in communities affected by the energy transition.
- · Advances Environmental Justice and Equity. The Budget includes historic support for underserved communities, including $70 million for Community Capacity Building initiatives in the Office of environmental Management and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to address areas of persistent poverty located around the Department's sites.  The Budget also includes $54 million for the Office of economic Impact and Diversity to help implement the Department's Justice40 Initiative efforts and equity action plan, and $13 million for the Office of Legacy Management (LM) to strengthen its environmental justice mission. The Budget supports programs, including Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research and Reaching a New energy Sciences Workforce in the Office of Science, to train and support a diverse and inclusive scientific workforce for the future.   In addition, the Budget includes $50 million for the newly established Office of State and Community energy Programs to launch a new energy Burden Reduction Pilot to lower energy costs of at least 3,000 lowincome homes while also reducing GHG emissions.  These investments would build healthy, sustainable, and resilient communities.
- · Reduces Health and Environmental Hazards for At-Risk Communities. The Budget includes $8.3 billion for the environmental Management program to support the cleanup of communities used during the Manhattan Project and Cold War for nuclear weapons production.  The Budget also provides $196 million for the LM to ensure cleanup remedies at these sites  remain protective of human health and the environment.  The Administration would ensure investments for the cleanup of legacy pollution and long-term stewardship support the Justice40 Initiative to benefit disadvantaged communities.
- · Strengthens the Cybersecurity and Resilience of the Energy Sector. The Budget provides $245 million to enhance the security of clean energy technologies and the energy supply chain.  The Budget also includes increased assistance to States, local governments, Tribes, and Territories for emergency planning and preparation, including for events caused by the impacts of climate change.
- · Strengthens the Nation's Nuclear Security Enterprise. The Budget makes historic investments in the Nation's nuclear security enterprise to implement the President's Nuclear Posture Review.  The Budget supports a safe, secure, and effective nuclear stockpile.  In addition,  the  Budget  continues  robust,  executable  funding  for  the  recapitalization  of  NNSA's physical infrastructure, including essential scientific and production facilities to ensure the deterrent remains viable.
- · Restores American Leadership in Arms Control and Nonproliferation. The Budget continues  to  enhance  DOe's  expertise,  infrastructure,  and  capabilities  needed  to  reduce nuclear risks and counter the global challenge of nuclear proliferation.  As called for in the Administration's National Security Strategy , the Budget supports DOe's efforts to secure nuclear and radiological materials and prevent terrorists from acquiring them.  The Budget also continues to strengthen the Nation's capability to respond to nuclear incidents at home and

abroad.  In addition, the Budget funds the development of more demanding verification technologies as part of an integrated approach to the future of arms control.

- · Powers the Nuclear Navy. DOe's  Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program ensures safe and reliable operation of reactor plants in nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers.  The Budget prioritizes investments in research and development to maintain American dominance while continuing to support improvements to the Naval Nuclear Laboratory infrastructure.

## DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for protecting the health and well-being of Americans through its research, public health, and social services programs. The President's 2024 Budget for HHS:  expands access to quality, affordable healthcare while lowering costs; dramatically improves access to early care and learning; advances the Cancer Moonshot; transforms behavioral healthcare; prepares for future pandemics; bolsters maternal health; advances health equity; transforms child welfare; combats hunger and improves nutrition and food safety; and supports rural health.

The Budget requests $144 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $14.8 billion or 11.5-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, excluding Contract Support Costs and Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 Section 105(l) lease amounts requested for the Indian Health Service (IHS), which the Budget proposes to shift from discretionary to mandatory funding.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Expands Access to Quality, Affordable Healthcare. The President believes that healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.  With enrollment in affordable health coverage at an all-time high, the Budget builds on the incredible success of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), by:  making permanent the expanded premium tax credits that the Inflation Reduction Act extended; and providing Medicaid-like coverage to individuals in States that have not adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, paired with financial incentives to ensure States maintain their existing expansions. The Budget makes significant investments in strengthening the Nation's long-term care system. The Budget invests $150 billion over 10 years to improve and expand Medicaid home and community-based services, such as personal care services, which allow older Americans and individuals with disabilities to remain in their homes and stay active in their communities. This $150 billion would improve the quality of jobs for home care workers and support family caregivers.  This investment is complemented by a robust agenda to:  improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, including efforts to improve ownership transparency; address the backlog of complaint surveys and provide adequate funding to conduct nursing home inspections; increase the inspection of low-performing nursing homes via the special focus facilities program; and expand financial penalties for substandard facilities.
- · Reduces Drug and Other Healthcare Costs for All Americans. The  Budget  builds upon the Inflation Reduction Act to continue lowering the cost of prescription drugs.  For Medicare, this includes further strengthening its newly established negotiation power by negotiating more drugs and bringing drugs into negotiation sooner after they launch.  The Budget also proposes to limit Medicare Part D cost-sharing for high-value generic drugs,

such as those used to treat chronic diseases like hypertension and high cholesterol, to no more than $2.  For Medicaid, the Budget includes proposals to ensure Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are prudent purchasers of prescription drugs, such as authorizing HHS to negotiate supplemental drug rebates on behalf of interested States in order to pool purchasing power.  For the commercial market, the Budget includes proposals to curb inflation in prescription drug prices and cap the prices of insulin products at $35 for a monthly prescription.

- · Protects  and  Strengthens  Medicare. The  Budget  would  extend  the  solvency  of  the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund by at least 25 years, without cutting any benefits or raising costs for people with Medicare.  The Budget includes key reforms to the tax code to ensure high-income individuals pay their fair share into the HI trust fund.  The Budget also directs the revenue from the Net Investment Income Tax into the HI trust fund as was originally intended.  In addition, the Budget credits the savings from the Budget's proposed drug reforms into the HI trust fund.
- · Expands Access to Affordable, High-Quality Early Care and Education. The Budget advances the President's goal of ensuring that all families can access affordable, high-quality child care and free, high-quality preschool, helping children learn, giving families breathing room, and growing the economy.  The President's plan enables States to increase child care options for more than 16 million young children and lower costs so that parents can afford to send their children to the high-quality child care program of their choice, allowing them to go to work or pursue training with the peace of mind that their children are being set up for a lifetime of success.  The Budget also funds a Federal-State partnership that provides high-quality, universal, free preschool offered in the setting of a parent's choice-from public schools to child care providers to Head Start-to support healthy child development and ensure children enter kindergarten ready to succeed.  The proposal enables States to increase preschool access and quality by providing high-quality preschool to all of the approximately four million four-year-old children in the Nation, and it gives States the flexibility to expand preschool to three-year-olds after preschool is available to all four-year-olds.  The estimated cost of these investments is $600 billion over 10 years.  In addition, the Budget provides $22.5 billion in discretionary funds for HHS's existing early care and education programs, an increase of $2.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level.  This includes $9 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, an increase of nearly $1 billion over the 2023 enacted level, to expand access to quality, affordable child care for families across the Nation.  The Budget also  helps  young  children  enter  kindergarten  ready  to  learn  by  providing  $13.1  billion  for Head Start, an increase of $1.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level.  In addition, Budget helps States improve their early childhood systems by building on existing Federal, State, and local early care and learning investments by funding the Preschool Development Grants program at $360 million, an increase of $45 million over the 2023 enacted level.
- · Advances Progress toward Cancer Moonshot Goals. The Cancer Moonshot Initiative aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years and improve the experience of people who are living with or have survived cancer, their families, and caregivers.  Reaching these goals will require progress in ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and ensure that the tools we have and those we develop along the way reach more Americans. Investments across the Cancer Cabinet agencies would be targeted to priority actions including:  close the screening gap; understand and address environmental exposure; decrease the impact of preventable cancers; bring cutting-edge research through the pipeline to patients and communities; and support patients and caregivers.  The Budget includes $1 billion for dedicated Cancer Moonshot activities across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

(CDC),  IHS,  the  Health  Resources  and  Services  Administration,  and  the  Food  and  Drug Administration (FDA), as well as a total investment at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of $7.8 billion to drive progress on ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer.  In addition, the Budget proposes to increase mandatory funding for the 21st Century Cures Act Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative at NCI through 2026.  In addition, the Budget provides an increase of $1 billion for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, for a total of $2.5 billion, to drive innovative health research and speed the implementation of breakthroughs that would transform the treatment, prevention, and early detection of cancer and other diseases.  As the Administration works to address the single biggest driver of cancer deaths in the Nationsmoking-the Budget also includes an investment of $258 million in tobacco prevention and control efforts at the CDC, including tobacco cessation activities to help Americans quit.

- · Transforms Behavioral Healthcare. The United States is facing a behavioral health crisis. Recently enacted legislation, such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, takes significant steps to address this crisis, and the Administration is working on implementing important behavioral health and school mental health investments. Still, much more can be done.  Nearly one in four adults 18 and older, and one in three adults aged 18 to 25, had a mental illness in the past year.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 24, and teen girls, in particular, are experiencing record high levels of violence, sadness, and suicide risk.  More than 46 million people had a substance use disorder, nearly 94 percent of whom did not receive treatment.  For people with private health insurance, the Budget expands coverage of mental health benefits and strengthens the network of behavioral health providers.  For people with Medicare, the Budget lowers patients' costs for mental health services, requires parity  in  coverage  between  behavioral  health  and  medical  benefits,  and  expands  coverage for behavioral health providers.  The Budget provides historic investments in the behavioral health  workforce,  youth  mental  health  treatment,  Certified  Community  Based  Behavioral Health Clinics, Community Mental Health Centers, and mental health research.  The Budget strengthens access to crisis services by investing in the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to address 100 percent of estimated contacts, scaling follow-up crisis services, and expanding CDC's suicide prevention program to all States, the District of Columbia, and 18 tribal and territorial jurisdictions.  To address the mental health crisis among adolescents, the Budget expands CDC's What Works in Schools program to up to 75 of the largest local education agencies.  The Budget also accelerates mental health research for promising new treatments and enhanced precision and implementation of existing treatments.
- · Invests  in  Community  Health  Centers  and  the  Nation's  Healthcare  Workforce. Because community health centers-which provide comprehensive services regardless of ability to pay-serve one in three people living in poverty and one in five rural residents, the Budget puts the Health Center Program on a path to double its size and expand its reach.  To bolster the healthcare workforce, the Budget expands the National Health Service Corps, which provides loan repayment and scholarships to healthcare professionals in exchange for practicing in underserved areas, and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical education Program, which trains residents in community-based healthcare clinics in rural and high-need areas. The Budget also addresses healthcare workforce shortages through new investments, including $32 million to increase the nurse faculty essential to growing the Nation's nurse workforce, and $28 million in innovative approaches to recruit, support, and train new providers.
- · Supports Family Planning Services for More Americans. For more than 50 years, Title X family planning clinics have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of high-quality family planning and preventive health services.  Most Title X clients live in poverty and the uninsured rate of Title X users is twice the national average, making the Title

- X family planning program a critical part of the public health safety net.  The program has served as a point of entry into care for nearly 195 million people over its more than 50-year history.  The Budget includes $512 million, a 79-percent increase above the 2023 enacted level, for the Title X Family Planning program to increase the number of patients served to 4.5 million.
- · Guarantees Adequate and Stable Funding for IHS. The Administration is committed to upholding the United States' trust responsibility to tribal nations by addressing the historical underfunding of IHS.  Consistent and predictable funding for IHS is critical to addressing historical underfunding and improving access to care.  The enactment of an advance appropriation for 2024 for IHS was a historic and welcome step toward the goal of securing adequate and stable funding to improve the overall health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Building on the advance appropriation, the Budget requests an additional $3 billion in discretionary resources in 2024 for a total of $8.1 billion in discretionary resources.  Furthermore, the Budget proposes to reclassify as mandatory IHS contract support costs and leases starting in 2024, for a total of $9.4 billion in discretionary and mandatory resources.  Beginning in 2025, the Budget proposes all resources as mandatory.  In 2024, the Administration will focus on implementing the advance appropriation and continuing consultation with Tribes on mandatory funding for IHS.  In 2025, the Administration would shift the IHS budget from mostly discretionary to all mandatory funding.  The mandatory proposal would automatically grow funding to keep pace with inflation and population growth, close longstanding service and facility shortfalls over time, and improve access to high-quality healthcare.  The Budget also proposes to reauthorize and increase funding for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians to $250 million in 2024.  This program has been critical in lowering the prevalence of diabetes in Indian Country.
- · Prepares for Future Pandemics and Other Biological Threats and Strengthens Public Health Systems. The United States must catalyze advances in science, technology, and core capabilities  to  prevent  and  prepare  for  future  biological  threats,  which  could  emerge  with increasing frequency.  The Budget includes $20 billion in mandatory funding for HHS public health agencies in support of the Administration's pandemic prevention and preparedness and biodefense priorities as outlined in the 2021 American Pandemic Preparedness:  Transforming Our Capabilities plan and 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering  Biological  Threats,  Enhancing  Pandemic  Preparedness,  and  Achieving  Global Health Security .  The Budget also includes $400 million in new discretionary resources within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response to prepare for pandemics and biological  threats,  as  well  as  key  discretionary  investments  for  the  Biomedical  Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Strategic National Stockpile to support advanced development and procurement of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic capabilities against known and unknown high priority threats.  The Budget includes a total of $10.5 billion in discretionary funding to build public health capacity at the CDC and at the State and local levels, including expanding capacity to respond to emerging threats, including surveillance, laboratory, and public health workforce capacities.  In addition, the Budget supports efforts to modernize public health data systems and enables the CDC to establish cadres of responseready staff who can quickly deploy during emergencies.  For the first time in decades, the Budget also includes $50 million for the Public Health emergency Fund to ensure HHS is able to respond to emerging public health threats without delay.  In addition, the Budget includes mandatory funding to catalyze development of drugs that address the pandemic threat of antimicrobial resistance.  The Budget also proposes key new HHS authorities to improve preparedness, incorporating lessons learned from recent public health emergencies, such as to enhance the visibility and the resilience of the medical product supply chain.

- · Advances Maternal Health and Health Equity. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, and rates are disproportionately high for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native women.  The Budget includes $471 million to:  support ongoing implementation of the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis and  reduce  maternal mortality and morbidity rates; expand maternal health initiatives in rural communities; implement implicit bias training for healthcare providers; create pregnancy medical home demonstration projects; and address the highest rates of perinatal health disparities, including by supporting the perinatal health workforce.  In addition, the Budget requires all States to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, eliminating gaps in health insurance at a critical time for women.  Recognizing that maternal mental health conditions are the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth, the Budget continues to support the maternal mental health hotline as well as screening and treatment for maternal depression and related behavioral disorders.  To address the lack of data on health disparities and further improve access to care, the Budget strengthens collection and evaluation of sociodemographic data.
- · Supports Rural Health. Rural America faces persistent disparities in access to healthcare, including higher uninsured rates, limited healthcare provider availability, and rural hospital closures.    Providing  Medicaid-like  coverage  to  individuals  in  States  that  have  not  adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, as the Budget proposes, is critical for rural communities.  The Budget also includes investments to improve the health of rural communities, including by helping rural hospitals stay open, expanding the pipeline of rural healthcare workers, and facilitating access to quality care.  The Budget includes $30 million to provide assistance to rural hospitals at-risk of closure and to support expansion of hospital service lines  to  meet  rural  communities'  needs.   The  Budget also supports rural healthcare workforce development and training programs and telehealth. Recognizing that rural communities have higher rates of suicide, and high rates of overdose deaths and mental illness, the Budget provides dedicated funding to rural communities, including rural health clinics, to support behavioral health.
- · Invests in the Treatment and Prevention of Infectious Diseases. The Budget invests in the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C, HIV, and vaccinepreventable diseases, by supporting comprehensive programs that would expand access to curative and preventive medications.  The Budget includes a new mandatory proposal for a national program to significantly expand screening, testing, treatment, prevention, and monitoring  of  Hepatitis  C  infections  in  the  United  States,  with  a  specific  focus  on  populations with high infection levels.  This program would support Federal procurement of life-saving treatments, while bolstering provider capacity and related public health efforts such as testing,  communication, and surveillance.  The Budget invests $850 million in the ending the HIV epidemic Initiative across HHS to aggressively reduce new HIV cases, increase access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (also known as PreP), and ensure equitable access to services and support for those living with HIV.  The Budget also reduces Medicaid costs by eliminating barriers to accessing PreP for Medicaid beneficiaries and proposes a new mandatory program to: guarantee PreP at no cost for all uninsured and underinsured individuals; provide essential wrap-around services through States, IHS, tribal entities, and localities; and establish a network of community providers to reach underserved areas and populations.  In addition, the Budget proposes a new Vaccines for Adults program to provide uninsured adults with access to routine and outbreak vaccines at no cost and expands the Vaccines for Children program to include all children under age 19 enrolled in CHIP.

- · Reduces Hunger and Diet-Related Chronic Diseases and Improves Food Safety. The Budget proposes investments in nutrition to help end hunger and reduce diet-related chronic diseases by 2030.  The Budget requests a total of $137 million in discretionary funding to address specific commitments made as part of the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health and corresponding National Strategy.  This includes funding:  to conduct nutrition research; to expand CDC's State Physical Activity and Nutrition Program to all States and Territories; to improve labeling to empower consumers to make good food choices; to enhance dietary and physical activity guidelines for Americans; and to increase support for senior nutrition programs.  The Budget proposes to expand Medicare access to cover nutrition and obesity counseling services and to pilot coverage of medically-tailored meals in Medicare.  The Budget also supports strengthening access to nutrition and obesity counseling in Medicaid.  In addition, the Budget strengthens FDA's ability to ensure that food is safe, particularly for infants and children.  The Budget provides investments in FDA to protect infants and children from toxic metals in food.  The Budget also invests in enhanced inspections of food manufacturing facilities, including infant formula facilities, and requires enhanced testing and reporting for Cronobacter contamination.  The Budget also requires more environmental monitoring with reporting to FDA.  In addition, the Budget invests in food supply chain continuity and FDA's smarter food safety initiative to strengthen data access and analysis capabilities to better target inspections.
- · Advances Child and Family Well-Being in the Child Welfare System. The Budget proposes to expand and incentivize the use of evidence-based foster care prevention services to keep families safely together and reduce the number of children entering foster care.  The Budget provides States with support and incentives to place more foster children with relatives or other adults who have an existing emotional bond with the children and fewer children in group homes and institutions, while also providing additional funding to support youth who age out of care without a permanent caregiver.  The Budget proposes to nearly double flexible funding for States through the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, and proposes new provisions to expand access to legal representation for children and families in the child welfare system.  The Budget provides $50 million in competitive grants for States and localities to advance reforms that would reduce the overrepresentation of children and families of color in the child welfare system, address the disparate experiences and outcomes of these families, and provide more families with the support they need to remain safely together.  In addition, the Budget provides $215 million for States and community-based organizations to respond to and prevent child abuse.
- · Supports Survivors of Domestic Violence and Other Forms of Gender-Based Violence. The Budget proposes significant increases to support and protect survivors of gender-based violence,  including  $519  million  for  the  Family Violence  Prevention  and  Services  (FVPSA) program and the National Domestic Violence Hotline to support domestic violence survivorsdouble the 2023 enacted level.  This amount continues funding availability for FVPSA-funded resource centers, including those that support the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex community.  The Budget would provide additional funding for domestic violence hotlines and cash assistance for survivors of domestic violence, as well as funding to support a demonstration project evaluating services for survivors at the intersection of housing instability, substance use coercion, and child welfare.  In addition, the Budget would provide over $66 million for victims of human trafficking and survivors of torture, an increase of nearly $17 million from the 2023 enacted level.
- · Supports America's Promise to Refugees. The Budget provides $7.3 billion to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to help rebuild the Nation's refugee resettlement infrastructure

and support the resettling of up to 125,000 refugees in 2024.  The Budget also helps ensure that unaccompanied immigrant children receive appropriate support and services while they are in ORR's care and are unified with relatives and sponsors as safely and quickly as possible. This funding would allow ORR to reinforce and expand on the programmatic improvements the Administration has made, including expanding access to counsel to help children navigate complex immigration court proceedings and enhancing case management and post-release services.  In addition, the Budget includes an emergency contingency fund that would provide additional resources, beyond the $7.3 billion, when there are unanticipated increases in the number of unaccompanied children or other humanitarian entrants, building on the contingency fund enacted for 2023.

- · Reduces Home Energy and Water Costs. The Budget provides $4.1 billion, a $111 million increase from the 2023 enacted level (excluding emergency appropriations), for the Low Income Home energy Assistance Program (LIHeAP).  LIHeAP helps families access home energy and weatherization assistance, vital tools for protecting vulnerable families' health in response to extreme weather and climate change.  As part of the Justice40 pilot, HHS plans to increase efforts to prevent energy shutoffs and increase support for households with young children and older people and high energy burdens.  Since the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) expires at the end of 2023, the Budget proposes to expand LIHeAP to advance the goals of both LIHeAP and LIHWAP.  Specifically, the Budget increases LIHeAP funding and gives States the option to use a portion of their LIHeAP funds to provide water bill assistance to low-income households.

## DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for:  protecting the United States from threats and hazards, modernizing effective programs to prevent terrorism; countering domestic violent extremism; securing the Nation's borders; enforcing U.S. immigration laws; protecting the President and other key officials; defending and securing Federal cyberspace and critical infrastructure; and ensuring disaster resilience, response, and recovery.  The President's 2024 Budget invests in climate resilience, Federal cybersecurity, maritime security, and secure and humane border management.

The Budget requests $60.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $0.6 billion or one-percent decrease from the 2023 enacted level.  This includes $1.6 billion in additional Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Passenger Security Fee offsetting collections gained from ending mandatory contributions to deficit reduction.  When controlling for the Passenger Security Fee proposal, the DHS request is an increase of two-percent above the 2023 enacted level.  The Budget also includes a proposed $4.7 billion Southwest Border Contingency Fund to respond to migration surges, which if fully accessed, would yield an increase for the total DHS request of nine-percent above the 2023 enacted level.  Resources provided through the Budget build on prior-year investments in cybersecurity, border security, and hazard mitigation.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Supports a Fair, Orderly, and Humane Immigration System. The Administration is committed to improving the Nation's immigration system and safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits.  The Budget includes $865 million for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to process an increasing asylum caseload, reduce the historically high immigration benefit request backlog, support the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, and improve refugee processing to advance the Administration's goal of admitting 125,000 refugees.
- · Enhances Border Security and Immigration Enforcement. Strengthening  border security  and  providing  safe,  lawful  pathways  for  migration  remain  top  priorities  for  the Administration.   The  Budget  includes  almost  $25  billion  for  United  States  Customs  and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs enforcement (ICe), an increase of almost $800 million over the 2023 enacted level when controlling for border management amounts.  The Budget includes funds for CBP to hire an additional 350 Border Patrol Agents, $535 million for border security technology at and between ports of entry, $40 million to combat fentanyl trafficking and disrupt transnational criminal organizations, and funds to hire an additional 460 processing assistants at CBP and ICe.

- · Addresses the Situation at the Southwest Border. Given elevated Southwest border encounter levels experienced in a number of years since 2019, and uncertainty surrounding border encounter levels in any given fiscal year, the Budget proposes a new $4.7 billion contingency fund to aid the Department and its components when responding to migration surges along the Southwest border.  Modeled on a contingency fund provided for unaccompanied children,  each  fiscal  year,  the  fund  would  receive  appropriations  incrementally,  and  above  the base appropriation, as Southwest border encounters reach pre-identified levels.  DHS would be limited to obligating funds for surge-related functions and would transfer funds to CBP, ICe, and Federal emergency Management Agency (FeMA) accounts with valid surge-related obligations.
- · Invests in Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Protection. To  make U.S. cyberspace more resilient and defensible, the Budget provides an additional $145 million for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), for a total of $3.1 billion.  This includes $98 million to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act and $425 million to improve CISA's internal cybersecurity and analytical capabilities.
- · Invests  in  Climate,  Health,  and  Natural  Disaster  Resilience. As  part  of  the Administration's efforts to address climate change, the Budget provides $3.9 billion for DHS's climate resilience programs, a $140 million increase from the 2023 enacted level.  This is in addition to $1 billion provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024.  The Budget helps State and local communities, Tribes, and Territories build climate resilience through various FeMA grant programs.  The Budget also includes more than $500 million for flood hazard mapping, including the development of new data to support future flood conditions. In addition, the Budget includes $236 million to support the Administration's 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security across a broad range of activities associated with response, critical infrastructure, and domestic surveillance.
- · Modernizes TSA Pay and Workforce Policies. The TSA workforce deserves to be fairly compensated at rates comparable with their peers in the Federal workforce.  The Budget includes $1.1 billion above the 2023 enacted level to fully fund the TSA pay equity initiative. enhancements to TSA pay support the President's commitment to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Federal workforce.
- · Invests in Sustainability and Conservation. The Administration remains committed to reestablishing the Federal Government as a leader in sustainability.  The Budget includes $123 million for DHS, the third largest department in the Federal Government and the Nation's largest law enforcement agency, to support market-shaping investments into Zero-emission Vehicles.  The Budget also provides $264 million for DHS to consolidate its physical footprint across the National Capital Region.  This funding builds upon the $500 million investment provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for sustainability and environmental programs.
- · Enhances America's Presence in the Arctic Region. establishing American presence in the Arctic is a critical security priority.  The Adversaries of the United States are increasing their presence in the Arctic and may seek to disrupt established norms for their own benefit. The Budget repeats the request from the 2023 Budget to buy a commercially available icebreaker to enhance the Nation's presence in the Arctic and ensure U.S. national sovereignty is respected in the region.  This capability would also ensure that the United States has greater access to support vulnerable communities in a region that is facing significant impacts from climate change.

- · Supports 2024 Presidential Campaign Security. The Budget includes funds to meet the protective and investigative mission requirements of the United States Secret Service (USSS). The Budget provides $3 billion to continue support for USSS' mission needs, including security for the upcoming 2024 Presidential Campaign.  The Budget also includes funding for 77 additional positions across the USSS.

## DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for creating healthy, safe, sustainable, and inclusive communities and affordable homes for all.  The President's 2024 Budget for HUD:  expands rental assistance to low-income households and increases affordable housing supply to reduce housing costs; expands homeownership opportunities for underserved borrowers; advances efforts to end homelessness; prevents and redresses housing-related discrimination; modernizes affordable housing by increasing climate resilience and energy efficiency; and strengthens communities facing underinvestment.

The Budget requests $73.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.1 billion increase or 1.6-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Expands Access to Affordable Rent through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. The HCV program currently provides 2.3 million low-income families with rental assistance to obtain housing in the private market.  The Budget provides $32.7 billion, an increase of  $2.4  billion  (including  emergency  funding)  over  the  2023  enacted  level,  to maintain services for all currently assisted families and to expand assistance to an additional 50,000 households, particularly those who are experiencing homelessness or fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence or other forms of gender-based violence.  The Budget further expands assistance to another 130,000 households with funding from HCV program reserves.  To further ensure that more households have access to safe and affordable housing, the Budget includes mandatory funding to support two populations that are particularly vulnerable to homelessness-youth aging out of foster care and extremely low-income (eLI) veterans.  The Budget provides $9 billion to establish a housing voucher program for all 20,000 youth aging out of foster care annually, and provides $13 billion to incrementally expand rental assistance for 450,000 eLI veteran families, paving a path to guaranteed assistance for all who have served the Nation and are in need.  In all, the Budget proposes to expand assistance to well over 200,000 additional households.
- · Increases Affordable Housing Supply to Reduce Costs. To address the critical shortage of affordable housing in communities throughout the Nation, the Budget provides $1.8 billion for the HOMe Investment Partnerships Program (HOMe), an increase of $300 million over the 2023 enacted level, to construct and rehabilitate affordable rental housing and provide homeownership opportunities.    In  addition,  the  Budget  provides  $258  million  to  support 2,200 units of new permanently affordable housing specifically for the elderly and persons with disabilities, supporting the Administration's priority to maximize independent living for people with disabilities.  To complement these investments, the Budget provides a total

of $51 billion in additional Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, and mandatory funding for new project-based rental assistance contracts to increase the development of affordable rental and owner-occupied housing, including units affordable to extremely low-income families.  By expanding the supply of housing, the Budget would help curb cost growth across the broader rental market.

- · Reduces Costs for New Homeowners and Expands Access to Homeownership. To make homeownership more affordable for underserved borrowers, including first-time, low- to moderate-income, and minority homebuyers, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is reducing the annual mortgage insurance premiums new borrowers will pay by about one-third. This action, effective in 2023, will save the average FHA borrower approximately $800 in the first year of their mortgage loan and provide continued savings for the duration of the loan. The Budget also includes $100 million for a HOMe down payment assistance pilot to expand homeownership opportunities for first-generation and/or low wealth first-time homebuyers and $15 million to increase the availability of FHA small balance mortgages.  In addition, the Budget proposes $10 billion in mandatory funding for a new First-Generation Down Payment Assistance program to help address racial and ethnic homeownership and wealth gaps.
- · Advances Efforts to End Homelessness. To prevent and reduce homelessness, the Budget provides $3.7 billion, an increase of $116 million over the 2023 enacted level, for Homeless Assistance  Grants  to  meet  renewal  needs  and  expand  assistance  to  approximately  25,000 additional households, including survivors of domestic violence and homeless youth.  These targeted  resources  would  support  the Administration's  recently  released Federal  Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. The Budget also provides $505 million for Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, serving a population with a disproportionately high rate of homelessness and providing a critical link to services.
- · Prevents Eviction. To assist renters in accessing resources to avoid eviction, make the legal process during eviction proceedings fairer, and mitigate future housing instability, the Budget provides $3 billion in mandatory funding for competitive grants to promote and solidify State and local efforts to reform eviction policies by providing access to legal counsel, emergency rental assistance, and other forms of rent relief.  The Budget also includes $10 million for the eviction Protection Grant program, which provides legal assistance to low-income tenants at risk or subject to eviction.
- · Advances Equity by Preventing and Redressing Housing Discrimination. The Budget provides $90 million to support State and local fair housing enforcement organizations and to further education, outreach, and training on rights and responsibilities under Federal fair housing laws.  The Budget also invests in HUD staff and technical assistance to affirmatively further fair housing and reduce barriers that restrict housing and neighborhood choice.
- · Improves the Quality of HUD-Assisted Housing. HUD-assisted multifamily properties and Public Housing provide 2.3 million affordable homes to low-income families.  The Budget centralizes inspection-related funding for these programs, which would enhance HUD's ability to identify and address financial and physical risks and would complement HUD's modernized National Standards for Physical Inspection of Real estate building standards.  The Budget also provides $3.2 billion for Public Housing modernization, and $300 million to improve the energy efficiency, climate resilience, and physical condition of the Public Housing stock.  To complement these investments, the Budget provides $7.5 billion in mandatory funding for comprehensive modernization of targeted Public Housing communities.

- · Reduces Lead and Other Home Health Hazards for Vulnerable Families. The Budget provides  $410  million  for  States,  local  governments,  and  nonprofits  to  reduce  lead-based paint  and  other  health  hazards  in  the  homes  of  low-income  families  with  young  children. The Budget also includes $25 million to address lead-based paint in Public Housing.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies the risk for lead exposure as greatest for children from racial and ethnic minority groups and children in families living below the poverty level.  The Lead Hazard and Healthy Homes grants, complemented by additional Government-wide  lead  remediation  investments  included  in  the  Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law, target interventions to these most at-risk communities.  In addition, the Budget targets $60 million specifically to prevent and mitigate housing-related health hazards, such as fire safety and mold, in HUD-assisted housing.
- · Supports Economic Development and Removes Barriers to Affordable Housing. The Budget provides $3.4 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program to help communities modernize infrastructure, invest in economic development, create parks and other public amenities, and provide social services.  The Budget includes $85 million within this total for a competitive program to reward State, local, and regional jurisdictions that make progress in removing barriers to affordable housing developments, such as restrictive zoning, as well as $10 billion in mandatory funding to incentivize the next group of jurisdictions to make similar zoning and land use reforms.  States and localities that embrace efforts to increase their supply of housing would ease cost growth for renters and homebuyers in those areas.
- · Invests in Affordable Housing in Tribal Communities. Native Americans  are  seven times more likely to live in overcrowded conditions and five times more likely to have inadequate plumbing, kitchen, or heating systems than all U.S. households.  The Budget provides over $1 billion to fund tribal efforts to expand affordable housing, improve housing conditions and infrastructure, and increase economic opportunities for low-income families.  Of this total, $150 million would prioritize activities that advance resilience and energy efficiency in housing-related projects.  The Budget also reflects a reduction in mortgage insurance fees for the Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program, which would save Native American borrowers over $500 on average in their first year and expand access to homeownership.

## DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

The Department of the Interior (DOI) conserves and manages the Nation's natural resources and cultural heritage.  The President's 2024 Budget for DOI: honors commitments to tribal nations; combats climate change and protects environmental resources by investing in ecosystem restoration, wildfire management, and public land resilience; enhances programs that advance racial and economic justice; supports development in U.S. Territories and freely associated states; and funds reclamation and climate resilience work that ensures healthy lands and waters and creates good-paying jobs.

The Budget requests $18.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.6 billion or 9.3-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, including amounts requested for Contract Support Costs and Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 Section 105(l) leases, which the Budget proposes to shift from discretionary to mandatory funding. The 2024 Budget complements historic investments in wildfire management, tribal programs, ecosystem restoration, national park operations, western water infrastructure, and abandoned mine land reclamation provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Invests in Tribal Communities to Honor Trust and Treaty Responsibilities. Building on feedback from extensive tribal consultations, the Budget provides historic increases for a range of key tribal programs.  The Budget invests $4.7 billion for DOI's tribal programs, $690 million above the 2023 enacted level, to support public safety and justice, social services, and educational needs to uphold Federal trust responsibilities and advance equity for Native communities.  This includes $717 million in Tribal Public Safety and Justice funding at DOI, an $86 million increase over the 2023 enacted level, to support pressing public safety needs in Indian Country and continue efforts to address the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons.  The Budget also includes:  a $28 million increase for Native Language Revitalization  grants;  ongoing  support  for  climate  resilience;  a  $61  million  increase  over the 2023 enacted level for education programs across the Bureau of Indian education's 183 elementary and secondary schools, and 33 tribal colleges, universities, and post-secondary schools; and a $148 million increase in education construction to support the replacement of seven schools and facilities.  To strengthen tribal land management, the Budget includes $12 million for a new Bureau of Indian Affairs program that would support tribal land acquisition for conservation and outdoor recreation, and promote tribal sovereignty through tribal co-stewardship.  The Budget also proposes to reclassify Contract Support Costs and Indian Self-Determination and education Assistance Act of 1975 Section 105(l) leases as mandatory spending, providing certainty for tribal communities in meeting these ongoing needs through dedicated funding sources.  The Budget's investments complement those made through the

Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address critical needs in tribal communities for infrastructure and climate adaptation.  In recognition of tribal nations' legacy of natural resources stewardship, the Budget supports efforts to advance tribally-led studies of the feasibility of reintroducing salmon populations in the Upper Columbia River.

- · Commits to Tribal Water Rights Settlements Funding. Providing a stable, dedicated funding source for tribal water rights settlements is crucial to ensuring that tribal communities have safe, reliable water supplies to improve public and environmental health and support economic opportunity.  To build on investments provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Budget provides $2.8 billion in mandatory funding to the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion Fund, with $2.5 billion to cover the costs of enacted and future water rights settlements and $340 million for operations and maintenance costs associated with enacted water settlements.
- · Strengthens Climate Resilience for Communities and Ecosystems. As  steward  for 20 percent of the Nation's lands and waters and with a primary responsibility to uphold the Nation's commitments to American Indians and Alaska Natives, DOI plays an integral role in addressing the climate crisis through strengthened conservation partnerships, including the Administration's America the Beautiful Initiative and science-based ecosystem management. The Budget invests $5.7 billion in climate adaptation and resilience, which would mitigate the impacts of climate change-such as drought, wildfire, and severe storms-on America's communities, lands, waters, and wildlife.  The Budget also sustains funding for key conservation  and  ecosystem management initiatives-including youth corps programs-alongside a historic $1.7 billion investment provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for ecosystem restoration across America and more than $5 billion provided by the Inflation Reduction Act to address climate change.
- · Increases Drought Resilience. The Budget helps ensure communities across the West have access to a resilient and reliable water supply by investing in rural water projects, water conservation, development of desalination technologies, and water recycling and reuse projects. The Budget complements the nearly $1.7 billion provided in 2024 for western water infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as the nearly $4.6 billion that was provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for drought mitigation and domestic water supply projects through the Bureau of Reclamation.  The Budget provides funding to address the ongoing drought in the western United States, including funding for WaterSMART, Central Valley Project drought activities, and implementation funding for the Drought Contingency Plans to conserve water in the Colorado River System, which is at historically low levels.
- · Invests in the Wildland Firefighting Workforce. The Budget ensures that no Federal firefighter would make less than $15 an hour and invests in the wildland firefighting workforce at DOI and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) through a new comprehensive and equitable compensation structure.  The Budget also increases the size of the wildland firefighting workforce at DOI and USDA and supports additional mental and physical health services for that workforce.  Together, these efforts would help address long-standing recruitment and retention challenges.  These investments, totaling $139 million over the comparable 2023 enacted level for DOI, would build upon the historic reforms in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and ensure that the workforce receives the enhanced support it needs to continue meeting evolving mission demands, as both the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires are expected to increase due to climate change.

- · Mitigates the Risk of Catastrophic Wildfires. The Budget invests $314 million in DOI's Hazardous Fuels Management and Burned Area Rehabilitation programs to help reduce the risk and severity of wildfires and restore lands devastated by catastrophic fire.  This funding complements the $878 million for hazardous fuels management and $325 million for burned area rehabilitation projects provided through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  The Budget also invests $7 million in a new integrated drought and fire science effort at the U.S. Geological Survey, which would help mitigate wildfire risk across the Nation.
- · Increases Access to Nature and Parks. An estimated 100 million Americans do not have an accessible park within a 10-minute walk of their home.  Communities of color and lowincome communities have disproportionately less access to Nature's benefits, such as clean water, clean air, and open spaces for recreation.  The Budget allocates $135 million to the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Program to develop high-quality recreation opportunities in economically disadvantaged urban communities.  The Budget also provides $3.8 billion for the National Park Service, $289 million over the 2023 enacted level.  In addition,  the  Budget includes a new $32 million initiative to build a more equitable National Park System, including investments to:  expand tribal co-stewardship of national parks; address transportation barriers  between  parks  and  underserved  communities;  improve  park  accessibility  for  visitors and employees with disabilities; and stand up the recently established African American Burial Grounds Preservation Program.  The Budget also includes a new $10 million initiative for Increasing Representation in Our Public Lands, which would support recent or potential new designations that preserve important places and tell the stories of those that have been historically underrepresented.
- · Accelerates  Clean  Energy  Development  on  Public  Lands. The  Budget  includes $181 million, an increase of $70 million from the 2023 enacted level, to accelerate the deployment of clean energy on public lands and waters, spurring economic development and creating thousands of good-paying jobs.  Funding would support the leasing, planning, and permitting of  solar,  wind,  and  geothermal  energy  projects,  and  associated  transmission  infrastructure that would help mitigate the impacts of climate change and meet the Administration's goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 25 gigawatts of clean energy capacity on public lands by 2025.
- · Creates Jobs Remediating and Reclaiming Abandoned Wells and Mines. The Budget provides $311 million to remediate orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaim abandoned mine lands on Federal and non-Federal lands.  The funding complements the $16 billion provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for orphaned well remediation and abandoned coal mine reclamation, and would create good union jobs and restore degraded lands and waters to allow for more productive uses.  The Administration is committed to the responsible and sustainable development of America's public resources.  Consistent with the need to develop a domestic critical minerals supply chain, the Department led an Interagency Working Group to review hardrock mine permitting and oversight on Federal lands, and will implement its recommendations on best practices and actions on public lands to increase transparency and ensure that mining operations adhere to strong social, environmental, and labor standards.
- · Advances Climate Science. The Budget invests $366 million at DOI to better understand the impacts of climate change, identify innovative mitigation and adaptation opportunities, and measure and monitor greenhouse gas emissions and sinks on Federal lands.  The Budget also supports the development of a Federal climate data portal that would provide the public with accessible information on historical and projected climate impacts, inform decision-making, and strengthen community climate resilience.

- · Increases  Permitting  Capacity. The  Budget  invests  in  environmental  permitting  programs to expedite delivery of new and modernized infrastructure.  The Budget also proposes to expand existing transfer authority by enabling Federal agencies to transfer funds provided under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries to improve efficiencies and increase capacity for environmental planning and consultation.  Together with existing law, this proposal would accelerate and improve environmental reviews in support of responsible development of priority infrastructure projects and energy solutions.
- · Invests in Addressing the Biodiversity Crisis. The  Budget increases biodiversity and halts  nature  loss  by  providing  targeted  increases  for  key  biodiversity  programs  including funding for:  endangered Species Act implementation; the National Wildlife Refuge System; migratory birds, fish, and aquatic conservation; and international conservation.  The Budget includes $20 million for the Coastal Program and $80 million to support the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, a flagship program for voluntary conservation on private lands-a key focus of the America the Beautiful Initiative.  This funding represents an increase of $26 million from the 2023 enacted level and complements a $1.7 billion cross-agency investment provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for fish passage projects to restore healthy aquatic ecosystems, and significant investments in the Inflation Reduction Act for endangered species recovery.

## DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for defending the interests of the United States and protecting all Americans as the chief enforcer of Federal laws.  The President's 2024 Budget for DOJ invests in:  combating gun violence and other violent crime, terrorism, violence against women, child exploitation, and cyber threats; protecting civil rights; implementing Federal, State, and local criminal justice reforms; improving the immigration court system; and bolstering antitrust enforcement.

The Budget requests $39.7 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $2.2 billion or 5.9-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Invests in Federal Law Enforcement to Combat Gun Violence and Other Violent Crime. The Budget makes robust investments to bolster Federal law enforcement capacity.   The Budget includes $17.8 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion above the 2023 enacted level, for DOJ law enforcement, including a total of $1.9 billion for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and explosives to expand multijurisdictional gun trafficking strike forces with additional personnel, increase regulation of the firearms industry, and implement the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  The Budget includes $1.9 billion for the U.S. Marshals Service  to  support  personnel  dedicated  to  fighting  violent  crime,  including  through  fugitive apprehension and enforcement operations.  The Budget also provides $51 million to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to support the continued implementation of enhanced background  checks  required  by  the  Bipartisan  Safer  Communities Act.    In  addition,  the Budget provides a total of $2.9 billion for the U.S. Attorneys, which includes 130 new positions to support the prosecution of violent crime.
- · Supports State, Local, and Tribal Law Enforcement and Public Safety. The Budget provides $4.9 billion in discretionary resources for State and local grants and $30 billion in mandatory resources to support State, local, and tribal efforts to protect U.S. communities and promote public safety.  This includes $537 million for the COPS Hiring Program discretionary topline, an increase of $213 million or 66 percent over the 2023 enacted level.
- · Reinvigorates Federal Civil Rights Enforcement. In order to address longstanding inequities and strengthen civil rights protections, the Budget invests $252 million, an increase of $62 million over the 2023 enacted level, in the DOJ Civil Rights Division.  These resources would support police reform via pattern-or-practice investigations, the prosecution of hate crimes, enforcement of voting rights, and efforts to provide equitable access to justice.

- · Prioritizes Efforts to End Gender-Based Violence. The Budget proposes $1 billion to support implementation of programs through the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA), which was recently reauthorized and strengthened in 2022.  This is a $300 million or 43-percent  increase  over  the  2023  enacted  level,  which  was  the  highest  funding  level  in  history. The Budget supports substantial increases for longstanding VAWA programs, including key investments in legal assistance for victims, transitional housing, and sexual assault services. The Budget strongly supports underserved and tribal communities by providing $35 million for culturally-specific services, $10 million for underserved populations, $15 million to assist enforcement of tribal special domestic violence jurisdiction, and $3 million to support tribal Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys.  The Budget also provides $14 million to address technological abuse through funding new VAWA programs to address cybercrimes against individuals. In addition, the Budget provides $120 million, an increase of $65 million above the 2023 enacted level, to the Office of Justice Programs for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative to address the rape kit backlog, and for the Regional Sexual Assault Investigative Training Academies Program.
- · Reforms the Federal Criminal Justice System. The  Budget  leverages  the  capacity  of the Federal justice system to advance criminal justice reform initiatives and serve as a model for  reform  that  is  comprehensive,  evidence-informed,  and  high-impact  in  terms  of  enhancing public safety and equity.  The Budget supports key investments in First Step Act of 2018 (FSA) implementation, including the continuation and expansion of the historic collaboration between the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the Department of Labor for a national initiative to provide comprehensive, intensive, and market-driven workforce development and reentry services to people in the Federal prison system, both during their time in BOP facilities and after they are transferred to community placement.  In total, the Budget continues to invest $409 million in base resources for FSA implementation, to support rehabilitative programming, improve conditions of confinement, and hire additional FSA-dedicated programmatic staff.
- · Reforms the Juvenile Justice System. The Budget proposes $760 million for juvenile justice programs, an increase of $360 million over the 2023 enacted level, to bolster diversionary juvenile justice strategies.
- · Counters  Cyber  Threats. The  Budget  expands  DOJ's  ability  to  pursue  cyber  threats through investments that support efforts to build cyber investigative capabilities at FBI field divisions nationwide.  These investments include an additional $63 million for more agents, enhanced response capabilities, and strengthened intelligence collection and analysis capabilities.  These investments are in line with the National Cybersecurity Strategy that emphasizes a whole-of-Nation approach to addressing the ongoing cyber threat.
- · Improves Immigration Courts. The Budget invests $1.5 billion, an increase of $595 million above the 2023 enacted level, in the executive Office for Immigration Review to further optimize the functioning of immigration courts and help address the backlog of over 1.8 million currently pending cases.  This funding supports 150 new immigration judge teams, which includes the support personnel required to create maximum efficiencies in the court system.  The Budget would also invest new resources in legal access programming, including $150 million in  discretionary  resources  to  provide  access  to  representation  for  adults  and  families  in immigration proceedings.  Providing resources to support legal representation in the immigration system would help make the system fairer and more equitable, while creating greater efficiencies in case processing.

- · Bolsters Antitrust Enforcement. Vigorous marketplace competition through robust enforcement of antitrust law can help reduce costs and raise wages.  The Budget advances this effort by including a historic increase of $100 million over the 2023 enacted level for the DOJ Antitrust Division.

## DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

The Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for protecting the health, safety, wages, and economic security of workers and retirees.  The President's 2024 Budget for DOL supports: building the skills of America's workers; protecting workers' rights and benefits, health and safety, and wages; strengthening the integrity and accessibility of the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program; and creating good, middle-class jobs that are safe and equitable, provide fair wages and benefits, empower workers, and offer opportunities for advancement.

The Budget requests $15.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.5 billion or 11-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Empowers and Protects Workers. Workers power America's economic prosperity, and to ensure workers are treated with dignity and respect in the workplace, the Budget invests $2.3 billion, an increase of $430 million above the 2023 enacted level, in the Department's worker protection agencies.  The Budget would enable DOL to protect workers' wages and benefits, combat exploitative child labor, address the misclassification of workers as independent contractors, and improve workplace health and safety.  The Budget also provides resources to support vigorous enforcement of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, especially where employers have retaliated against or otherwise penalized employees for taking federally protected leave from work.  The Budget also ensures fair treatment for millions of workers by providing resources to oversee and enforce the equal employment obligations of Federal contractors, including protections against discrimination based on race, sex, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
- · Expands Penalties when Employers Violate Workers' Rights to Organize, Receive Fair Wages, and Have a Safe and Healthy Workplace Free from Discrimination. employers  often  receive  only  a  slap  on  the  wrist-at  most-when  they  fire  or  retaliate against workers for exercising their right to organize and collectively bargain, steal wages from workers, force workers to work in unsafe conditions, exploit children, or otherwise flagrantly violate the Nation's labor laws.  To deter employers from violating workers' rights, ensure those who do violate their rights are held accountable, and level the playing field for responsible  employers,  the  Budget  also  proposes  instituting  and  meaningfully  increasing penalties at DOL, the equal employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board for employers that violate workplace safety, health, wage and hour, child labor, equal opportunity, and labor organizing rules.
- · Calls  for  Paid  Sick  Leave  for  All  Workers. Millions  of  workers  in  America  have  to choose between a needed paycheck-or even a job-and taking care of a family member or

themselves when they are sick.  Workers without paid sick days are more likely to go to work when sick, send their child to school when sick, and do without the healthcare they need to get better.  Paid sick days are not only good for workers and families-they are also good for business, leading to lower employee turnover and increased productivity, and reducing the spread of contagious diseases.  The President calls on the Congress to require employers to provide seven job-protected paid sick days each year to all workers, and ensure that employers cannot penalize workers for taking time off to address their health needs, or the health needs of their families, or to seek safety from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

- · Expands Access to Paid Family and Medical Leave. The vast majority of America's workers do not have access to paid family leave, including three out of four private sector workers. Among the lowest-paid workers, who are predominately women and workers of color, 92 percent have no access to paid family leave through their employers.  As many as one in five retirees leave the workforce earlier than planned to care for an ill family member, which negatively impacts families as well as the Nation's labor supply and productivity.  The Budget proposes to establish a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program administered by the Social Security Administration to ensure that all workers can take the time they need to:  bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one's military deployment; find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or grieve the death of a loved one.  The Budget also includes $10 million for DOL's Women's Bureau to help States expand access to paid leave benefits, including through grants to support States in implementing new paid leave programs and through the creation of a Technical Assistance Hub to share best practices among States.
- · Expands Workforce Training that Provides Pathways to Good Jobs. The President's historic legislative accomplishments are rebuilding U.S. infrastructure, supporting clean energy, and boosting American manufacturing while creating millions of high-quality jobs.  The Budget invests in effective, evidence-based training models that would ensure all workers, particularly women, workers of color, those living in rural areas, workers with disabilities, and others underrepresented in growing fields, have the skills they need to compete for and fill these and other jobs.  The Budget provides $200 million for a new Sectoral employment through Career Training for Occupational Readiness (SeCTOR) program, which would support the development and expansion of public-private partnerships among employers, education and training providers, and community-based groups to equitably deliver high-quality training focused on growing industries.  SeCTOR's approach is based on decades of research showing that when employers take a leading role in the design and implementation of training, workers-especially underserved workers-gain access to high-quality programs that lead directly to good, in-demand jobs.
- · Expands  Access  to  Registered  Apprenticeships. The  Budget  increases  support  for Registered Apprenticeship, an evidence-based earn-and-learn model that is a critical tool for training future workforces in the construction, clean energy, semiconductor, transportation and logistics, education, and other growing and in-demand industries.  The Budget invests $335  million,  a  $50  million  increase  above  the  2023  enacted  level,  to  expand  Registered Apprenticeship  opportunities  in  these  high-growth  fields  while  increasing  the  number  of workers from historically underrepresented groups, including people of color and women, who participate in Registered Apprenticeships.
- · Supports  Community  Colleges  in  Providing  High-Quality  Training. The  Budget recognizes the critical role that community colleges play in providing accessible, affordable, and high-quality training.  The Budget invests $100 million, a $35 million increase above the

2023 enacted level, to build community colleges' capacity to work with the public workforce development system and employers to design and deliver high-quality training programs in communities across the Nation.

- · Expands Employment Protections for Military Spouses. Military families make significant sacrifices on behalf of the Nation, including overcoming the many challenges that spouses of active-duty service and reserve members experience in finding and retaining good jobs.  A Department of Defense survey found that 33 percent of military families had experienced a permanent change in location within the last 12 months.  Spouses of military servicemembers often face discrimination from current and prospective employers due to the frequent and unpredictable nature of deployment and relocations.  The Budget addresses these challenges by expanding anti-discrimination and reemployment protections to spouses of all active duty and reserve members, which would allow them to more easily find and keep good jobs.
- · Modernizes, Protects, and Strengthens UI. The  UI  program provides a critical safety net for workers who have lost a job through no fault of their own and helps protect the economy as a whole from further damage during downturns.  UI was critical in helping millions of Americans through unexpected job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, the pandemic also exposed vulnerabilities in the program.  The Budget invests $3.7 billion, an increase of $522 million above the 2023 enacted level, to modernize, protect, and strengthen the  UI  program.   This  includes  investments  aimed  at  tackling  fraud,  including  funding  to support more robust identity verification for UI applicants, help States develop and test fraudprevention tools and strategies, and allow the DOL Office of Inspector General to increase its investigations into fraud rings targeting the UI program.  In addition, the Budget proposes a comprehensive legislative package of program integrity proposals designed to provide States with new tools and resources to combat UI fraud and improper payments while ensuring equity and accessibility for all claimants.  The Budget also includes principles to guide future efforts to reform the UI system, including improving benefit levels and access, scaling UI benefits automatically during recessions, expanding eligibility to reflect the modern labor force, improving State and Federal solvency through more equitable and progressive financing, expanding reemployment services, and further safeguarding the program from fraud.
- · Supports Legacy Energy Communities. To address changes in the energy economy, the Budget continues to invest in strategic planning, partnership development, and training and reemployment activities for displaced workers.  The Budget provides $20 million to support DOL's role in the multi-agency Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and economic Revitalization (also known as POWeR+) Initiative, which aims to assist displaced workers and transform local economies and communities transitioning away from fossil fuel production to new, sustainable industries.  The Budget also includes $67 million for Workforce Opportunities for Rural Communities.  This program-administered in partnership with the Appalachian Regional  Commission,  the  Delta  Regional  Authority,  and  the  Northern  Border  Regional Commission-aims to help Appalachian, Delta, and Northern Border communities develop local and regional workforce development strategies that promote long-term economic stability and opportunities for workers, especially those connected to the energy industry.  In addition, the Budget provides $20 million for DOL to partner with AmeriCorps and other agencies to establish a Civilian Climate Corps program to help communities address the climate crisis by creating service opportunities and job training programs in emerging industries.
- · Strengthens Mental Health Parity Protections. The Budget requires all health plans to cover mental health and substance use disorder benefits, ensures that plans have an adequate network of behavioral health providers, and improves DOL's ability to enforce the law.  In

addition, the Budget includes $275 million over 10 years to increase the Department's capacity to ensure that large group market health plans and issuers comply with mental health and substance use disorder requirements, and expand the Agency's capacity to take action against plans and issuers that do not comply.

## DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS

The Department of State (State), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other international programs advance a free, secure, and prosperous world by working with allies and partners to solve shared global challenges.  The President's 2024 Budget demonstrates this shared commitment through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to catalyze public and private finance.

The President's 2024 Budget requests $70.5 billion in discretionary funding for State, USAID, and other international programs, which is $7 billion or 11 percent above the 2023 enacted level when including $2.1 billion in base funding that was shifted to emergency in 2023, and $9 billion or 15 percent above the 2023 enacted level when excluding those amounts.  Within this total, the Budget includes $63.1 billion for State and USAID, $5 billion or 9 percent above the 2023 enacted level when including the shifted funding and $7 billion or 13 percent above the 2023 enacted level when excluding those amounts.  The 2024 total also includes $4 billion for international programs at the Department of the Treasury, $1.7 billion or 71 percent above the 2023 enacted level.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Out-Competes  China  and  Asserts  U.S.  Global  Leadership. During  these  unprecedented and extraordinary times, the Budget requests both discretionary and mandatory resources to Out-Compete China and advance American prosperity globally.  The out-compete mandatory proposal would strengthen the U.S. role in the Indo-Pacific and advance the U.S. economy by investing:  $2 billion to support 'hard' critical international infrastructure; $2 billion to scale the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's (DFC) equity program; and $2 billion to bolster Indo-Pacific countries through economic competitiveness and secure and resilient supply chains.  As part of this mandatory proposal, the Budget also requests $6.5 billion in economic assistance over the next 20 years for the Compacts of Free Association with the freely associated states of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau.
- · Advances PGII. The Budget supports more than $50 billion through PGII in direct foreign assistance, development and export finance, and private sector funding.  PGII leverages public and private finance to advance climate and energy security, health and health security, digital connectivity, gender equity and equality, and related transportation infrastructureall while creating opportunities for American businesses.
- · Increases  Global  Energy  Security,  Infrastructure,  and  Resilience. The  Budget supports the President's pledge to:  work with the Congress to more than quadruple U.S. international climate financing; and request more than $3 billion for the President's Emergency

Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) .  This includes a $1.6 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund and a $1.2 billion loan to the Clean Technology Fund.  The Budget also advances new tools, such as loan guarantees, to reassert U.S. global leadership in the Indo-Pacific by financing energy security and infrastructure projects and reducing reliance on volatile energy supplies and prices.  The Budget also builds resilience to better prepare for and respond to extreme weather events and other disasters.

- · Bolsters American Leadership in Global Health. To  reinforce  U.S.  leadership  in  addressing global health and health security challenges, the Budget includes $10.9 billion, a $370 million increase above the 2023 enacted level.  This includes over $1.2 billion to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks-including by expanding U.S. bilateral partnerships with countries to improve health security capacity.  This over $1.2 billion also includes $500 million for the Pandemic Fund to catalyze and accelerate improvements to global health security and pandemic preparedness.  The Budget also invests dedicated funds for the Administration's Global Health Worker Initiative to enhance global efforts to better train, equip, and protect the health workforce-which would strengthen countries' abilities to provide core health services and respond to crises.  The Budget also increases investments in high-impact and lifesaving voluntary family planning and reproductive health programs to address significant unmet global needs for these services.  The Budget sustains U.S. leadership in the Global Fund's historic seventh replenishment, providing $2 billion for the second year of a $6 billion, three-year pledge to save lives and accelerate the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.
- · Deepens Alliances and Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. The  Budget  includes  more than $2.3 billion in discretionary funding for State and USAID to support an open, secure, and connected Indo-Pacific and implement the Indo-Pacific Strategy to strengthen and modernize America's alliances and partnerships in this vital region.  This total includes $90 million for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and $50 million for the advancement of the IndoPacific economic Framework for Prosperity.  In addition, the Budget expands funding for U.S. diplomatic presence throughout the region, with particular focus on the Pacific Islands.  The Budget also includes an additional $2 billion in mandatory funding to make game-changing investments to Out-Compete China and deepen America's partnerships in the region-working to make Indo-Pacific economies more resilient and connected.  The Budget also proposes $6.5 billion in economic assistance over the next 20 years for the Compacts of Free Association with the freely associated states of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau.
- · Makes  Transformative  Investments  in  High-Quality  International  Infrastructure. Targeted global infrastructure connects workers to good jobs, allows businesses to grow and thrive, and supports global connection among nations.  Unfortunately, infrastructure has long been underfunded internationally, with more than $40 trillion in estimated need in low- and middle-income countries through 2035.  As part of a broader effort to Out-Compete China, the Budget requests  $2  billion  in  mandatory  funding  over  five  years  to  support  investments  in 'hard' critical international infrastructure, combat predatory People's Republic of China (PRC)financed infrastructure projects, and spur U.S. economic growth.  The Budget also includes a $2 billion mandatory proposal to bolster the DFC's equity program at scale as a key financing tool necessary to strengthen the U.S. role in the Indo-Pacific.  The new DFC mandatory resources would be structured as a revolving fund on a cash basis to allow DFC to recycle any realized returns from its initial investments without further appropriation.  The Budget also provides more than $1 billion in discretionary funds for the Millennium Challenge Corporation to build critical infrastructure, reduce poverty, and incentivize democratic governance.

- · Strengthens  International  Digital  Connectivity. The  Budget  requests  more  than $395 million to advance global cyber and digital development initiatives, including State's Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, USAID's Digital Strategy, PGII digital connectivity efforts, and regional initiatives such as Digital Transformation with Africa.  Across this work, the Budget:  bolsters U.S. and allied technology leadership; advances inclusive and responsible technology development, which also supports the ability of women, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex community, and other marginalized groups to safely access digital technologies; strengthens supply chain security; and enhances cooperation on privacy, data sharing, and digital trade.  The Budget would support working with a broad range of partners to ensure an open, trusted, interoperable, reliable, and secure digital backbone and other advanced communication technologies in low- and middle-income countries.
- · Advances Gender Equity and Equality Around the World. The Administration remains steadfast in its commitment to invest in opportunities for women and girls and support the needs of marginalized communities, including the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and  Intersex  community.    Reflective  of  that  commitment,  the  Budget  requests  more  than $3 billion to advance gender equity and equality across a broad range of sectors.
- · Reinforces Collective Action to Address Global Challenges. The Budget supports continued U.S. multilateral engagement on shared global challenges at the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations.  The Budget fully meets U.S. annual contributions to international organizations and pays UN peacekeeping dues on time and in full.  The Budget also proposes increases for key opportunities to advance U.S. interests and compete with adversaries, including by:  strengthening collective security through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; bolstering U.S. leadership at the UN by beginning to synchronize $40 million in annual contributions; providing $150 million to support a U.S. return to the UN educational, Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization;  and  contributing  $57  million  to  support  the  UN Population Fund.  The Budget also requests nearly $2.3 billion for contributions to multilateral development banks, maintaining the United States' role as the largest World Bank donor to support poverty reduction and development in low- and middle-income countries.  This includes a $1.4 billion investment in the International Development Association (IDA) as part of the United States' pledge of $3.5 billion in support of the most recent IDA replenishment. The Budget also proposes the largest request for the Peace Corps in history in order to sustain operations and partner with host countries to address global challenges and spur U.S. development leadership.
- · Builds Security and Prosperity in Central America and Haiti. The Budget requests more than $1 billion to advance the President's commitment to work with the Congress to provide $4 billion over four years to address the root causes of migration and improve the lives of people in Central America.  This assistance would bolster localization efforts, enhance the rule of law, and support economic growth for all segments of society.  In addition, in response to deteriorating conditions and widespread violence in Haiti, the Budget invests $291 million to strengthen Haiti's recovery from political, health, and economic shocks, by strengthening the capacity of the Haitian National Police, combating corruption, strengthening the capacity of civil society, responding to health emergencies and health needs, and supporting services for marginalized populations.
- · Bolsters  Hemispheric  Economic  Investment  and  Migration  Management  Efforts. In support of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, the Budget invests $430 million for hemispheric migration management.  This assistance would bolster stability for affected communities, enhance legal pathways and protection in the region, and strengthen

humane border management throughout the region.  The Budget proposes a new regional economic opportunity fund, the Americas Partnership Opportunity Fund, to address migration management challenges faced by high and upper-middle income countries in the region. The Budget also requests up to $40 million for the Global Concessional Financing Facility to support programs aimed at improving the lives of migrants and refugees in the Western Hemisphere and $75 million for the Inter-American Development Bank's IDB Invest to increase private sector investment in the Americas.

- · Strengthens Democracy and Defends Human Rights Globally. The Budget provides more than $3.4 billion to advance democratic governance, promote respect for human rights, and foster democratic renewal.  The Budget would strengthen free and independent media, fight corruption, bolster democratic institutions, advance technology for democracy, promote gender equality and women's civic and political participation, and defend free and fair elections and political processes.  Within this total, the Budget includes $345 million for the President's Initiative for Democratic Renewal, $25 million for the President's new African Democratic and Political Transitions initiative, as well as targeted increases for 'bright spot' countries experiencing democratic opportunities.
- · Sustains U.S. Leadership on Refugee and Humanitarian Issues, including Addressing Food Insecurity. The Budget requests more than $10.5 billion to respond to the persisting needs of the world's most vulnerable, including those needs arising from conflict and natural disasters.  The Budget supports the United States' revitalized refugee admissions program, including the resettlement of up to 125,000 refugees and related efforts, such as Uniting for Ukraine.  In addition, the Budget supports the President's pledge to alleviate global food insecurity by providing nearly $1.2 billion in bilateral agriculture and food security programming.
- · Counters Malign Influence. To  assert  U.S.  leadership  in  strategic  competition  with  the PRC, the Budget includes $400 million for the Countering PRC Influence Fund.  In addition, the Budget requests $753 million for Ukraine to continue to counter Russian malign influence and to meet emerging needs related to security, energy, cybersecurity, disinformation, macroeconomic stabilization, and civil society resilience.  The Budget also requests continued Foreign Military Financing loan and loan guarantee authority to ensure the availability of a financing tool to help America's partners invest in U.S. equipment.
- · Deepens Engagement with Africa. The Budget includes more than $8 billion in foreign assistance for sub-Saharan Africa to advance the goals of the U.S. Strategy for sub-Saharan Africa and the commitments made during the U.S. Africa's Leaders' Summit.  This funding: fosters new economic engagement; reinforces the U.S.-Africa commitment to democracy and human rights; strengthens regional and global health and health security; promotes food security; advances peace and security, especially in the Sahel; and responds to the climate crisis.
- · Supports De-Escalation and Integration in the Middle East. The Budget includes a new Middle east and North Africa Opportunity Fund to support priorities for U.S. engagement and respond to prospects for de-escalation and peace across the region.  The Budget also requests: $3.3  billion  for  assistance  consistent  with  the  U.S.-Israel  Memorandum  of  Understanding; $1.45 billion in assistance for Jordan; and $1.4 billion to support the U.S. strategic partnership with egypt.  As part of the Administration's commitment to advancing security, prosperity, and freedom for both Israelis and Palestinians, the Budget also requests $259 million for critical assistance to the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as across the region, in support of a two-state solution with Israel.

- · Protects Afghan Allies. The Budget supports enduring Welcome (eW), the whole-of-Government  effort  to  expeditiously  process  the  applications  of  Afghan  allies,  such  as  Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) candidates, and family reunification cases, and welcome them to the United States-while simultaneously safeguarding national security.  The Budget fully supports implementation of eW by leveraging State balances estimated to enable more than $2 billion in support in 2024, and by proposing a substantial increase to the number of SIVs available for Afghan allies.
- · Sharpens America's Tools of Statecraft. State  and  USAID  are  at  the  forefront  of  the response to today's global challenges.  The resources requested in the Budget would enable expertise and innovation, while supporting reforms, the establishment of new missions, and deployment of U.S. diplomats and development experts when and where they are needed in the field.  The Budget requests more than $8.2 billion to recruit, retain, and develop a diverse and high-caliber national security workforce and modernize U.S. diplomatic and development systems, particularly in the Indo-Pacific.  The Budget also expands upon the Administration's significant investments to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across its people, policies, processes, programs, and partnerships.

## DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for ensuring that the United States has a safe, equitable, reliable, and modern transportation system.  The President's 2024 Budget for DOT continues to complement and support the President's historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which would strengthen the Nation's transportation system by:  tackling large infrastructure projects; improving roadway and pedestrian safety; providing more resilient and sustainable transportation options; expanding the Nation's capacity to move goods quickly; and helping communities address critical transportation challenges.

The Budget requests $27.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.8 billion or 6.7-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level (excluding $2.6 billion in one-time congressionally-directed spending items).  The Budget also includes $80.3 billion in contract authority and obligation limitations, and $36.8 billion in emergency-designated advance budget authority, for transportation infrastructure investments in 2024.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Continues Implementation of the President's Historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The  Budget provides a total of $76.1 billion for highway, highway safety, and transit formula programs, supporting the amounts authorized for year three of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  This includes $60.1 billion for the Federal-Aid Highway program, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to the 2023 enacted level, to continue repairing and upgrading the Nation's highways and bridges, which builds upon the 3,700 bridges and 69,000 miles of roadway improvement projects initiated in 2022.  This funding would also support building out a national network of electric vehicle chargers, consistent with the approved plans of 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to achieve the President's climate and Made in America goals.  The Budget also includes $14 billion for Transit Formula Grants, a $356 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, to support core capital and planning programs for transit agencies across the Nation, as well as transit research, technical assistance, and data collection.
- · Ensures  a  Safe  and  Efficient  Passenger  and  Freight  Rail  Network. The  Budget expands on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's already significant investments toward improving the safety and efficiency of the Nation's rail network.  When combined, this includes $1.5  billion  for  the  Consolidated  Rail  Infrastructure  and  Safety  Improvements  program, the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) most flexible, and oversubscribed, competitive grant program, as well as $850 million to fund projects that improve safety at critical railway crossings.  The Budget continues the Administration's robust investment in safe and efficient intercity passenger rail through a combined $7.5 billion in grants to Amtrak.  In addition, the Safety &amp; Operations account funds critical safety programs, such as the Confidential Close

Call Reporting System, which allows railroads and their employees to report unsafe events and conditions without fear of negative consequences from the FRA or reprisal from their employers.

- · Advances Long-Stalled  Significant Transportation  Projects. The  Administration  is committed to advancing the Nation's most urgent and complex transportation infrastructure projects.  To compliment the significant resources in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Budget provides $1.2 billion for the National Infrastructure Project Assistance program (also known as the Mega grant program), $560 million for Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Grants, and $2.9 billion for transit Capital Investment Grants.  These funds would support transformational projects to increase safety, improve mobility for commuters and freight traffic, address climate change, and spur shared economic growth.  This includes the President's commitment to provide significant Federal support for the Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project in the New York City region, which is an essential element of the Northeast Corridor, the busiest and most complex rail corridor in the Nation.
- · Supports the Nation's Transit Systems. The Nation's transit systems play a critical role in ensuring riders can access jobs, school, healthcare, and opportunity, along with spurring sustainable economic development, reducing highway congestion, and lowering climate emissions.  However, transit systems face an uncertain future as ridership and fare revenue have not fully rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic, given significant shifts in work and commuting patterns.  To ensure transit continues to be a vital and viable transportation option, the Budget includes language to temporarily allow larger transit systems to use existing formula funds for operating expenses.  The Budget also encourages States to support their transit systems by transferring available Federal-Aid Highway funding for transit operating needs.
- · Addresses the Roadway and Pedestrian Safety Crisis. Despite  improvements in vehicle safety technologies, 42,915 people died on America's roads in 2021, the highest total in over a decade.  The Budget provides over $1.3 billion for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), an increase of $116 million above the 2023 enacted level, which would allow NHTSA to conduct critical research to reduce roadway fatalities and injuries on the Nation's highways.  These efforts include:  better understanding of the crash impacts on pedestrians by vehicles of different sizes and weight; accelerating the development of a side impact female dummy to address gender equity in crash testing; and researching accessibility and inclusiveness in vehicle design.  The Budget also builds on the essential work the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is conducting with its Large Truck Crash Causal Factors Study by providing resources to begin a complementary Medium-Duty Truck Crash Causal Factors Study.  The Budget also provides $60 million for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Lawcreated Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program, an increase of $15 million from the 2023 enacted level, to build safe walking and bicycling facilities that connect people with public transportation, businesses, workplaces, schools, and other communities, all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
- · Tackles 21 st  Century Aviation Challenges. The Budget provides $16.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  This funding would continue the hiring and training surge of air traffic controllers started in 2023 to rebuild the pipeline of new controllers needed to meet projected traffic demands.  The Budget increases investment in the facilities and systems that comprise the National Airspace System (NAS) by over $500 million to $3.5 billion, to address maintenance and modernization and to ensure the NAS continues to safely accommodate the growth in traditional commercial aviation traffic alongside new entrants from the commercial space, unmanned aircraft, and advanced air

mobility industries.  The Budget also includes continued investment in FAA's multiyear effort of reforming aircraft certification, as well as increasing its safety oversight capabilities.  The resources provided through the Budget complement the $5 billion already provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024 to upgrade the FAA's air traffic control facilities and to improve the safety, capacity, accessibility, and efficiency of the Nation's airports.  The Budget also requests a $3 million increase to bolster aviation consumer protection activities by DOT. This includes hiring eight additional staff, building on an increase of eight staff starting in 2023, and information technology system enhancements to reduce the backlog of aviation consumer complaints, expedite rulemaking, and increase outreach and enforcement.  The FAA's current  authorization-FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, Public  Law  115-254-expires on September 30, 2023.  The FAA's next authorization will need to:  improve safety; enable access to the system by current and emerging users; make long-term investments to improve the safety and efficiency of the NAS, reduce emissions, deliver on climate action, and enhance resiliency; expand consumer protection; and improve the standards of service and access for air travelers and other stakeholders.

- · Moves Goods More Quickly through the Nation's Ports and Waterways. The Budget continues support for modernizing America's port and waterway infrastructure initiated under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.   The Budget includes $230 million for the Port Infrastructure Development Program to strengthen maritime freight capacity on top of the $450 million in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024.  In addition to keeping the Nation's supply chain moving by improving efficiency, DOT would prioritize projects that also lower emissions-reducing environmental impact in and around the Nation's ports.
- · Invests in Merchant Mariner Training. The Budget provides $196 million for the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) to support an exemplary standard of excellence in education and training opportunities for the next generation of diverse seagoing officers and maritime leaders to serve the Nation.  Within this amount is more than $2 million for sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response activities, newly created subject matter expert Advisory Council positions, and expanded measures to support survivors of sexual assault.  Also within this amount, the Budget proposes $92 million in priority maintenance and improvement projects at the USMMA campus.

## DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is responsible for maintaining a strong economy, promoting economic conditions that enable growth and stability, protecting the integrity of the financial system, combating global financial crime and corruption, and managing the U.S. Government's finances and resources effectively.  The President's 2024 Budget for Treasury: supports a fair and robust tax system that ensures compliance by the wealthy and large corporations; improves taxpayer experience and service; expands resources for community development, job-creating investments, and access to credit in disadvantaged communities; and rebuilds institutional capacity to advance equity across all Treasury programs.

The Budget requests $16.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $2.1 billion or 15-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Improves Taxpayer Experience and Supports a Fair and Equitable Tax System. The Inflation Reduction Act addressed long-standing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) funding deficiencies by providing $79.4 billion in stable, long-term funding through 2031 to improve tax compliance by finally cracking down on high-income individuals and corporations who too often avoid paying their lawfully owed taxes and improving service for the millions of Americans that do pay their taxes.  The funding will allow the IRS to modernize information technology infrastructure, administer new energy tax credits, and rebuild the administrative capacity of the Agency.  To realize these goals and support timely and robust implementation  of  the  important  tax  provisions  in  the  Inflation  Reduction Act,  annual  discretionary appropriations are necessary to maintain current services and allow the IRS to utilize the long-term funding for transformative modernization.  To ensure that taxpayers receive the highest quality customer service and that all Americans are treated fairly by the U.S. tax system, the Budget provides a total of $14.1 billion for the IRS, $1.8 billion, or 15 percent, above the 2023 enacted level.  This includes an increase of $642 million to improve the taxpayer experience and expand customer service outreach to underserved communities and the entire taxpaying public.  The Budget also provides $290 million for IRS Business Systems Modernization, which did not receive annual funding in 2023, to continue and accelerate the development of new digital tools to enable better communication between taxpayers and the IRS.  In addition to annual discretionary funding, the Budget proposes to maintain deficit reducing Inflation Reduction Act-funded initiatives in 2032 and beyond.  This proposal builds on decades of analysis demonstrating that program integrity investments to enforce existing tax laws increase revenues in a progressive way by closing the tax gap-the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid.

- · Expands  Access  to  Credit  to  Underserved  Communities. The  Budget  provides $341 million for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, an increase of $17 million, or five percent, above the 2023 enacted level, which provides historically underserved and often low-income communities access to credit, capital, and financial support to grow businesses, increase affordable housing, and reinforce healthy neighborhood development.  To better address the shortage of long-term affordable credit for development projects in disadvantaged communities and unlock up to $500 million in financing support, the Budget also includes a $10 million subsidy for the CDFI Fund's Bond Guarantee Program.
- · Increases Corporate Transparency and Safeguards the Financial System. Treasury plays  a  leading  role  in  monitoring  and  disrupting  corruption,  money  laundering,  terrorist financing, and the use of the financial system by malicious actors domestically and abroad, including as part of the Administration's response to Russian aggression against Ukraine.  The Budget provides $244 million to the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, $28 million above the 2023 enacted level, to expand Treasury's capacity to provide financial intelligence and  conduct  sanctions-related  economic  analysis  while  continuing  to  modernize  the  sanctions process.  The Budget also provides $229 million for the Financial Crimes enforcement Network, $39 million above the 2023 enacted level, to support the launch of the Beneficial Ownership Secure System and to invest in the Treasury offices charged with closing financial reporting loopholes that allow illicit actors to evade scrutiny, mask their dealings, and undermine corporate accountability.
- · Strengthens Enterprise Cybersecurity. The Budget provides $215 million, an increase of $115 million above the 2023 enacted level, to protect and defend sensitive agency systems and  information,  including  those  designated  as  high-value  assets.    The  Budget  increases centralized funding to strengthen Treasury's overall cybersecurity efforts and continue the implementation of a Zero Trust Architecture.  These investments would protect Treasury systems from future attacks.
- · Restores  Critical  Agency  Capacity. The  Budget  provides  $332  million  for  Treasury's Departmental Offices, a 21-percent increase over the 2023 enacted level, to restore staffing levels for Treasury's core policy offices to 2016 levels and support Treasury's expanding role in promoting investment security and advancing equitable growth.  The increase in funding would also support Treasury's Climate Hub and establish a climate-related technical support center  to  conduct  assessments  of  climate-related  risks  across  Government  programs.   The Budget builds institutional capacity to support Treasury-wide coordination of program evaluation and expand engagement with historically underrepresented and underserved groups to advance equity across all Treasury programs.

- · Prioritizes Veterans' Mental Health Services and Suicide Prevention. The  Budget invests $139 million within VA research programs, together with $16.6 billion within the VA Medical Care program, to increase access to quality mental healthcare and lower the cost of mental health services for veterans, with the goal of helping veterans take charge of their treatment and live full, meaningful lives.  This effort includes support for the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies on risk and prevention factors.  In addition, the Budget provides $559 million to further advance the Administration's veteran suicide prevention initiatives, including continued expansion of the Veterans Crisis Line's 988 and additional support for VA's National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide.
- · Supports Women Veterans' Healthcare. The Budget invests $12.6 billion for women veterans'  healthcare,  including  $1  billion  toward  women's  gender-specific  care.    More  women are choosing VA healthcare than ever before, with women accounting for over 30 percent of the increase in enrolled veterans over the past five years.  Investments support comprehensive specialty medical and surgical services for women veterans, increase access to infertility counseling and assisted reproductive technology, and eliminate copayments for contraceptive coverage.  The Budget also improves the safety of women veterans seeking healthcare at VA facilities by supporting implementation of the zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment and assault.
- · Bolsters  Efforts  to  End  Veteran  Homelessness. The  Budget  invests  $3.1  billion  for veterans' homelessness programs, with the goal of ensuring every veteran has permanent, sustainable housing with access to healthcare and other supportive services to end current veteran homelessness and prevent veterans from becoming homeless in the future.  In addition, the Budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides $13 billion in  mandatory  funding  to  incrementally  expand  the  Housing  Choice  Voucher  program  for 450,000 extremely low-income veteran families, paving a path to guaranteed assistance for all who have served the Nation and are in need.
- · Invests in Caregivers Support Programs. Recognizing the critical role family caregivers play in supporting the health and wellness of veterans, the Budget provides robust funding for the Program of General Caregivers Support Services.  The Budget also specifically provides $2.4 billion for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, which includes stipend payments and support services to help empower family caregivers of eligible veterans.
- · Invests in Overdose Prevention and Treatment Programs.

## CORPS OF ENGINEERS-CIVIL WORKS

The Army Corps of Engineers -Civil Works program (Corps) is responsible for:  developing, managing, restoring, and protecting water resources primarily through the construction, operation and maintenance, and study of water-related infrastructure projects; regulating development in waters of the United States; and working with Federal agencies to help communities respond to and recover from floods and other natural disasters.  The President's 2024 Budget for the Corps invests in high return projects, promotes environmental justice, increases climate resilience, and improves the supply chain at the Nation's coastal ports and on the inland waterways.

The Budget requests $7.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024.  The Budget is complemented by $1 billion for operation and maintenance and $50 million for construction in 2024 from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Invests in High Return Projects. The Budget invests in projects and programs within the main mission areas of the Corps, which are commercial navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration, that provide a high economic or environmental return, increase resilience to climate change, promote environmental justice, or address a significant risk to public safety.  For example, the Budget addresses high priority dam safety risks and facilitates safe and efficient navigation on the highest use inland waterways.
- · Improves the Nation's Infrastructure. The Budget:  invests in operating and maintaining the Corps' existing infrastructure and improving its reliability; and builds on $1 billion provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024 for operating and maintaining Corps' infrastructure.  The Budget supports more efficient investment in infrastructure by proposing to transfer ownership from the Corps to parties that are better suited to maintain it, where appropriate.  For example, the Budget includes an initial $350 million for replacement of the Cape Cod Canal bridges, toward a commitment of $600 million, and a legislative proposal that would allow the Corps to transfer those funds to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which is better suited to design and construct the replacement bridges.  The Budget proposes authorizing the Corps to transfer ownership of these bridges to the Commonwealth, which would be responsible for their future operation and maintenance.
- · Strengthens Supply Chains at Coastal Ports and Inland Waterways. The  Budget invests in five projects that facilitate safe, reliable, and environmentally sustainable navigation at the Nation's coastal ports and on the inland waterways.  The Budget also includes over $1.7 billion in spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to support commerce through U.S. coastal ports and over $1 billion to maintain and improve navigation on the inland waterways.

- · Increases Climate Resilience. The Budget invests in 45 projects and programs that would decrease  climate  risks  facing  communities  and  to  increase  ecosystem  resilience  to  climate change based on the best available science.  The Budget would improve reservoir operations through updates to water control operating manuals and drought contingency plans and would promote healthier downstream ecosystems through reoperation of Corps' reservoirs under the sustainable rivers program.  The Budget also invests in helping local communities identify and address their risks associated with climate change and takes climate change into account in developing options and selecting projects.

As part of a long-term strategy to reduce repetitive flood losses, the Administration will convene an interagency working group, including the Corps, the Federal emergency Management Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to develop and propose an objective methodology that Federal agencies could use to identify the 10-20 communities across the Nation that are likely to have the highest risk of repetitive storm-related flooding over the next 50 years-in the absence of further measures to reduce this risk and with the intention of informing future Federal investments in these areas.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on bipartisan principles for these and other flood risk management investments.

- · Promotes Environmental Justice. The Budget invests $35 million in technical and planning assistance, in 23 studies, and in the construction of 33 projects to help disadvantaged and tribal communities address their water resources challenges in line with the President's Justice40 Initiative-including funding for the Tribal Partnership Program.  In addition, the Corps is considering revising its benefit-cost analyses for proposed flood and storm damage reduction projects and related investment decisions to provide a more equitable way to account for the welfare benefits of these projects in disadvantaged communities.
- · Restores Aquatic Ecosystems. The Budget invests in the restoration of some of the Nation's most unique aquatic ecosystems, such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Upper Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, and the Louisiana Coast.  The Budget includes $415 million for Florida's everglades restoration program and $93 million to support salmon recovery efforts in the Columbia River Basin.    In  addition,  the  Corps  is  undertaking  an  analysis  of  how  aquatic ecosystem restoration projects can offset greenhouse gases emissions by promoting carbon sequestration on a carbon lifecycle basis for each project.
- · Invests in Research and Development (R&amp;D). The Budget includes $86 million for R&amp;D, with a focus on innovative solutions that would help achieve significant cost savings in the civil works program and address the emerging water resources challenges of the 21 st  Century, including climate change.  For example, this investment would help reduce the cost to maintain existing water resources infrastructure and improve its reliability, safety, and environmental sustainability-including through more effective water management at certain dams and innovative methods to identify risks to existing infrastructure.

The President's 2024 Budget for EPA supports the continuing restoration of the Agency's capacity to carry out its mission to protect clean air and water, tackle the climate crisis, and promote environmental justice.

The Budget requests $12 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.9 billion or 19-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Restores Critical Capacity to Carry Out EPA's Core Mission. Staffing reductions under the previous administration continue to undermine the Agency's ability to carry out its mission to protect clean air and water, tackle the climate crisis, and promote environmental justice.  The Budget adds more than 2,400 Full Time equivalents (FTes) relative to 2022 levels, for a total of more than 17,000 FTes, to help rebuild the Agency's capacity.  Restoring staffing capacity across the Agency would enable ePA to better protect the Nation's health by: helping cut air, water, and climate pollution; and advancing environmental justice.  The Budget would also fund a significant expansion of ePA's paid student internship program to develop a pipeline of qualified staff.
- · Tackles the Climate Crisis with Urgency. The Budget prioritizes tackling climate change with the urgency that science demands.  Resources in the Budget support efforts to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis while spurring economic progress and creating good-paying jobs.  The Budget includes nearly $5 billion to address the climate crisis by:    reducing  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions;  building  resilience  in  the  face  of  climate impacts; and engaging with the global community to respond to this shared challenge.  The Budget also proposes an additional $64.4 million to implement the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 to continue phasing out potent GHGs known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).  The Budget also includes investments to support the private sector in calculating GHG emissions and climate risk and setting science-based climate targets, as well as investments to embed the economic impacts of climate change and decarbonization efforts within Government economic projects.
- · Advances Environmental Justice. The Administration continues to prioritize efforts to deliver environmental justice in communities across the United States, including meeting the President's Justice40 commitment to ensure at least 40 percent of the benefits of Federal investments in climate and clean energy reach disadvantaged communities, including rural and  tribal  communities.    The  Budget  bolsters  these  efforts  by  investing  nearly  $1.8  billion across numerous programs in support of environmental justice efforts throughout the

Agency.  These investments would support creating good-paying jobs, cleaning up pollution, implementing the Justice40 Initiative, advancing racial equity, and securing environmental justice for communities that bear the brunt of toxic pollution and impacts of climate change. The Budget also includes $91 million for technical assistance to support capacity building for communities to advance equity and justice.

These resources would advance efforts to upgrade drinking water and wastewater infrastructure nationwide, with a focus on underserved and rural communities that have historically been overlooked.  The Budget also funds all of the authorizations in the original Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021 and maintains funding for ePA's State Revolving Funds at the total 2023 enacted level, which complements funds provided for water infrastructure programs in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
- · Supports  the  President's  Goal  of  Replacing  All  Lead  Pipes. The  Budget  provides $219 million for two grants dedicated to remediating lead contamination in water-Reducing Lead  in  Drinking  Water  and  Lead  Testing  in  School  and  Child  Care  Program  Drinking Water-an increase of $163 million over the 2023 enacted level.  The Budget also funds other grants and loans that can be used for lead service line replacements.  This investment builds on the $15 billion in direct funding for lead service lines provided through the Bipartisan Infrastructure  Law.    The  Budget  updates  the  cross-Government  Lead  Pipe  Replacement Funding Inventory that was published for the first time with the 2023 Budget.
- · Protects Communities from Hazardous Waste and Environmental Damage. Preventing and cleaning up environmental damage that harms communities and poses a risk to public health and safety continues to be a top priority for the Administration.  The Budget provides $356 million for the Superfund program to continue cleaning up some of the Nation's most contaminated lands and respond to environmental emergencies and natural disasters, while using an estimated $2.5 billion in Superfund tax revenue that would be available to ePA in 2024 to fund cleanup of contaminated sites, Superfund enforcement, and emergency response activities.    Total  budgetary  resources  for  the  Superfund  program  would  be  approximately $2.9 billion in 2024, compared to the $1.7 billion available in 2023.  The Budget also provides $217 million for ePA's Brownfields program to provide technical assistance and grants to communities so they can safely clean up and reuse contaminated properties, as well as $20 million for the new Alaska Contaminated Sites Program.  These programs support the President's Cancer Moonshot initiative by addressing contaminants that lead to greater cancer risk.
- · Tackles  Per-  and  Polyfluoroalkyl  Substances  (PFAS)  Pollution. PFAS are  a  set  of man-made chemicals that threaten the health and safety of communities across the Nation, disproportionately impacting historically disadvantaged communities.  To tackle PFAS pollution,  the  Budget provides approximately $170 million, $44 million over the 2023 Budget request, for ePA to continue working toward commitments made in the 2021 PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA's Commitments to Action 2021-2024 ,  including:  increasing America's knowledge of PFAS impacts to human health and ecological effects; restricting use to prevent PFAS from entering the air, land, and water; and remediating PFAS that have been released into the environment.
- · Ensures Safety of Chemicals for People and the Environment. ePA has a responsibility under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to ensure the safety of chemicals in or entering commerce and addressing any unreasonable risks to human health or the environment.  The

Budget continues to build core capacity for the TSCA program with an investment of $130 million, $49 million above the 2023 enacted level.

- · Enforces  and  Assures  Compliance  with  the  Nation's  Environmental  Laws. The Budget provides $246 million for civil enforcement efforts, which includes funding to increase enforcement efforts in communities with high pollution exposure and to prevent the illegal importation and use of HFCs in the United States.  The Budget also includes:  $165 million for compliance monitoring efforts, including funds to conduct inspections in underserved and overburdened communities, and funds to rebuild the inspector corps; and $75 million for criminal enforcement efforts, which includes funding to increase outreach to victims of environmental crimes and to develop a specialized criminal enforcement task force to address environmental justice issues in partnership with the Department of Justice.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Ensures the Future Is Made in America. NSF plays a key role in the CHIPS and Science Act  with  its  focus  on  U.S.  leadership  in  new  technologies-from  artificial  intelligence  to biotechnology and computing-all of which are critical to both America's future economic competitiveness and U.S. national security.  The $11.3 billion Budget request for NSF would strengthen U.S. global leadership in the technologies of the future by accelerating the development of key technologies and establishing dynamic, collaborative networks for research and innovation.  By investing in American R&amp;D, the Budget would generate benefits for a broad range of stakeholders and communities, including socially and economically disadvantaged workers and businesses.
- · Strengthens U.S. Leadership in Emerging Technologies. The Budget provides NSF $1.2 billion for the CHIPS and Science Act authorized Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships to help accelerate and translate scientific research into innovations, industries, and jobs.  The purpose of the Directorate is to work with programs across the Agency and with other Federal and non-Federal entities to expedite technology development in emerging areas that are crucial for U.S. technological leadership.  The Budget provides $300 million to invest in the Regional Innovation engines program, bringing together State and local governments, institutions of higher education, labor unions, businesses, and community-based organizations across the Nation to galvanize use-inspired research, technology translation, and workforce development.
- · Spurs Climate Research and Development. The  Budget provides $1.6 billion for climate research and development, an increase of $630 million above the 2023 enacted level. This robust investment would support research in:  atmospheric composition; water and carbon cycles; renewable energy technologies; climate resilience technologies for communities heavily affected by climate change; social, behavioral, and economic research on human responses to climate change; and more.  In addidtion, the Budget proposes $15 million for a

new fellowship that would provide researchers studying disparate impacts of climate change with a broader skillset to address the interactions of science and policy in this complex area.

- · Expands STEM Workforce and Advances Racial and Gender Equity in STEM. The Budget provides $1.4 billion, a $198 million increase from the 2023 enacted level, to accelerate STeM education and workforce development, and to help ensure the U.S. science and technology workforce reflects the Nation as a whole.  In addition, the Budget includes $420 million to increase:  the participation of historically underrepresented communities and women and girls in science and engineering fields; support for curriculum design; research on successful recruitment and retention methods; development of outreach or mentorship programs; fellowships; and science and engineering research and education capacity at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions.
- · Fosters Scientific and Technological Advances. The Budget provides $2 billion for research and development to maintain America's edge in the industries of tomorrow, including advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, microelectronics and semiconductors, and quantum information science.
- · Strengthens the Nation's Research Infrastructure. The Budget provides $2.4 billion for research infrastructure at NSF to support the construction and procurement of research facilities and instrumentation across the Nation to enable scientific and technological advances. The Budget supports major NSF research facilities, including:  long-term upgrades of NSF's major Antarctic infrastructure; finishing construction of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which would conduct deep surveys of the night sky, creating an unprecedented data set to unlock some of the universe's biggest mysteries; upgrades to the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest particle accelerator; and construction of the Leadership-Class Computing Facility to support science and engineering research that requires the largest and most computationally intensive capabilities.

## SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is responsible for ensuring that small businesses and entrepreneurs have access to the information and resources they need to start, grow, or recover their business.  The President's 2024 Budget for SBA supports historic investments in counseling and training programs, expands access to capital, supports innovation, and promotes access to Government contracting opportunities.

The Budget requests $987 million in discretionary budget authority for 2024.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Broadens Access to Capital for Small Businesses. The Budget supports historic lending levels across the 7(a), 504, Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), and Microloan programs.  The nearly $58 billion in lending provided in the Budget would address the need for greater access to affordable capital, particularly in underserved communities.  Increasing the authorized lending level for the SBIC program by 20 percent to $6 billion would significantly expand the availability of venture capital funding for small businesses.
- · Expands Counseling and Training Resources. The Budget provides $30 million for the Community Navigator Pilot Program, which leverages community organizations to reduce barriers for starting a business and expand access to business counseling and training resources for veterans, women, rural communities, and communities of color.
- · Bolsters  Support  for  Innovators. The  Budget  provides  $30  million  to  support  SBA's Growth Accelerator Fund Competition, Regional Innovation Clusters, and the Federal and State Technology Partnership Program to provide entrepreneurs at various technical readiness levels with a network of technical assistance providers, including accelerators, State and local economic development agencies, colleges and universities, and other technology-based economic development entities.  This technical assistance provides small business entrepreneurs access to the tools, networks, and services they need to commercialize cutting-edge innovation and bring solutions to the market.
- · Expands Opportunities for Veterans. In January 2023, SBA began accepting applications for the Veteran Small Business Certification Program to expand small business contracting opportunities for veterans.  The Budget provides $20.5 million to continue building on the successful implementation of the program and to ensure that veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses have access to business opportunities across the Federal Government.

## SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for providing essential benefits to retirees, survivors, individuals with disabilities, and older Americans with limited income and resources.  The President's 2024 Budget for SSA supports investments in improving service delivery and advancing equity.  The Budget also proposes to establish a nationwide paid family and medical leave program that would give workers the time they need to care for themselves or a loved one or to bond with a new child.

The Budget requests $15.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.4 billion or 10-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, including allocation adjustment funding.

## The President's 2024 Budget:

- · Protects the Benefits that Americans Have Earned. The  Administration is committed to protecting and strengthening Social Security, and opposes any attempt to cut Social Security benefits.    The  Administration  looks  forward  to  working  with  the  Congress  to  strengthen Social Security by ensuring high-income individuals pay their fair share.  In addition, the Administration looks forward to improving the Supplemental Security Income program to help low-income older Americans and people with disabilities afford their basic needs.
- · Improves Service Delivery. each year, SSA processes more than six million retirement, survivors, and Medicare claims, as well as more than two million disability and Supplemental Security Income claims.  The Budget provides an increase of $1.4 billion, 10 percent over the 2023 enacted level, to improve customer service at SSA's field offices, State disability determination services, and teleservice centers for retirees, individuals with disabilities, and their families.  The Budget also improves access to SSA's services by adding staff to process more disability claims and reduce wait times.
- · Provides National, Comprehensive Paid Family and Medical Leave. The vast majority of America's workers do not have access to paid family leave, including three out of four private sector workers.  Among the lowest-paid workers, who are predominantly women and workers of color, 92 percent have no access to paid family leave through their employers.  As many as one in five retirees leave the workforce earlier than planned to care for an ill family member, which negatively impacts families as well as the Nation's labor supply and productivity.  The Budget proposes to establish a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program administered by SSA.  The program would:  provide workers with progressive, partial wage replacement to take time off for family and medical reasons; include robust administrative funding; and use an inclusive family definition.  The Budget would provide up to 12 weeks of leave to allow eligible workers to take time off to:  care for and bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address

circumstances arising from a loved one's military deployment; or find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.  The Budget would also provide up to three days to grieve the death of a loved one.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to make this critical investment and strengthen America's economy.

- · Advances Equity and Accessibility. The Administration is committed to making it easier for people to access the services they rely on, including individuals experiencing homelessness, children with disabilities, and people with mental and intellectual disabilities.  The Budget makes  investments  to  decrease  customer  wait  times,  simplify  the  Supplemental  Security Income application processes, and increase outreach to people who are difficult to reach.  SSA will  also  continue  to  modernize  its  information  technology  systems  to  make  more  services available online and improve 800 Number access for those who call.

## Table S-7. Funding Levels for Appropriated ('Discretionary') Programs by Category-Continued

(Budget authority in billions of dollars)

- * Less than $500 million.
- 1 The 2022 actual and 2023 enacted levels include changes that occur after appropriations are enacted that are part of budget execution such as transfers, reestimates, and the rebasing as mandatory any changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) enacted in appropriations bills. The 2022 and 2023 levels are adjusted to add back OMB's scoring of CHIMPs enacted in 2022 and 2023 appropriations Acts for a better illustrative comparison with the 2024 request levels.
- 2 The 2023 enacted levels for base funding include the $12.5 billion primarily for base activities that was designated as emergency funding in Public Law 117-328.
- 3 The 2024 Budget proposes to shift contract support costs and 105(l) leases within the Indian Health Service (IHS) in HHS and the Bureau of Indian Programs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior to the mandatory side of the Budget starting in 2024. The Budget further proposes to shift all of IHS to mandatory starting in 2025 as well. See the 'Budget Process' chapter of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget for more information on these proposals.
- 4 The 2024 Budget presents funding for anomalous or above-base activities such as emergency requirements, program integrity, disaster relief, wildfire suppression, and 21st Century Cures appropriations outside of base allocations, which is largely consistent with allocation adjustments in the FY 2022 Congressional Budget Resolution (H.Con.Res. 14) and the FY 2023 deeming resolution in the House of Representatives (H.Res. 1151).
- 5 The section presents base discretionary funding by both defense and non-defense and by security and nonsecurity allocations. The definition of security and nonsecurity is the same as the definition specified in the Budget Control Act of 2011 with security including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the International Budget Function (150), and the Intelligence Community Management Account and with all other discretionary programs in the nonsecurity category. This presentation of discretionary excludes the proposed shifts to mandatory.
- 6 The amounts in the 2024 Budget are based on the National Security and National Defense strategies and the Department of Defense Future Years Defense Program, which includes a five-year appropriations plan and estimated expenditures necessary to support the programs, projects, and activities of the Department of Defense. After 2028, the Budget reflects outyear growth rates consistent with the FY 2023 President's Budget.
- 7 Section 905(c) of division J of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58; IIJA) specified that amounts provided in division J and certain rescissions in section 90007 of IIJA should be considered as emergency discretionary appropriations. The amounts provided as discretionary appropriations in IIJA are summarized here, however, these amounts are kept separate from other discretionary amounts included above that are considered during the regular appropriations process.
